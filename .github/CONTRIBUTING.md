# Contributing

### Please read this entire document before making any contributions.

1. Always use common sense.
2. Don't disrespect, insult or berate any other contributors, be nice.
3. Contributing is a voluntary thing people choose to do if they wish, nothing is offered in return.
4. Pull Requests: You MUST keep pull requests focused/isolated, don't put lots of unrelated/different things into 1 PR. It's significantly better, easier and faster that you make 100 PRs with each having their own change, rather than trying to put lots of changes in 1. You can group things together but they must be somewhat related (focused on the same thing).
5. Pull requests (new code, new features, changes to existing things, etc) MUST be tested. You must test your code. You can do this by setting up your own discord bot, ask us for help with this if possible. Untested code will not be accepted, except in some circumstances of very minor changes.
6. Always check with Magnaboy before starting to code something (e.g. a new minigame, or boss, etc), unless its a small QoL/bugfix. Otherwise, it's possible you will code something that wont be accepted, or you might code it in an unacceptable way they needs to be rewritten, etc. Always discuss with Magnaboy and other contributors.
7. If you have any question or problem when trying to contribute, just ask in the developers channel.
