In order to obtain a pet cat, a player must complete the [[Gertrude's Cat]] quest, after which [[Gertrude]] will give them a [[kitten]] as part of the reward. After three hours, the kitten will grow into a pet cat. Cats no longer need the food nor attention required of a kitten, and will not run away.\n\nAfter another five-six hours of having the adult cat following the player, it will become an [[overgrown cat]]. Overgrown cats can be trained into [[wily cat]]s, that will eventually become [[lazy cat]]s. Lazy cats can repeatedly be trained back into wily cats.\n\nOnly one kitten may be owned at a time, including the [[hellkitten]] variant. Players may purchase a new kitten from [[Gertrude]] for {{Nocoins|100}} coins whenever their current kitten turns into an overgrown cat, or their cat is stored in a [[player-owned house]] [[menagerie]]. The colour of the kitten will be randomised, unless the player wears a [[ring of Charos (a)]] while purchasing the kitten, which allows them to choose the colour.\n\nAny type of cat can be turned into a [[Hellcat]] variant by chasing the [[hell-rat]]s in [[Evil Dave's Basement of Doom|Evil Dave's basement]]. Hellcats can be morphed back into their original colour by feeding them a [[bucket of milk]]. \n\nCats can be interacted with in a number of ways, such as by stroking them, showing them a [[ball of wool]] or wielding a [[mouse toy]] while the cat follows the player. Cats may be spoken to with a [[catspeak amulet]], or without it after partial completion of [[Dragon Slayer II]]. They can also ''chase'' [[rat]]s, with a [[Rat#Cats|successful catch rate]] depending on the type of cat. Regular adult cats have a success rate of 50%.\n\nPlayers may name their wily and lazy cats by speaking to [[Felkrash]] after the completion of [[Ratcatchers]].\n\nSimilar to every pet, cats can be stored in the [[menagerie]] of a [[player-owned house]]. They however cannot be insured by [[Probita]] and will run off if the player dies, if they were either in the player's inventory or following the player.\n\nPlayers can ''use'' their adult cats, including hellcats, on [[civilian]]s in [[West Ardougne]] in the south-western area of the city to sell it to them for 100 [[death runes]] ({{Coins|{{GEP|Death rune|100}}}}). This increases to 200 death runes ({{Coins|{{GEP|Death rune|200}}}}) with the [[Ardougne Diary#Easy|easy Ardougne achievement diary]] reward. Cats can also be shooed-away if the player no longer wishes to keep them.\n\nIf a cat dies in combat, it is permanently lost and the message {{mes|colour=black|bg=DarkGrey|Your cat has passed away.}} will appear in the chatbox. Cats cannot die in a [[Menagerie#Arena|Menagerie arena]]. Cats can also be lost if they are following the player when their [[members]]hip expires. If a cat is lost and replaced, quest dialogue will not reflect this; the replacement will recall events as though they were the same cat.\n\n==Combat stats==\n[[File:Cat.gif|right|thumb|A cat walking.|250px]]\nWhen fighting [[Hell-Rat Behemoth]]s, the [[King rat]] or in the [[Rat Pits]], cats have the following combat stats:{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1221515347687366657|date=27 January 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/4aRke|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=[do you know the actual levels for each type of cat?] Attack, Strength, Defence, HP for each...\nKitten: 1, 1, 0, 4\nGrown: 4, 3, 0, 6\nOvergrown: 3, 5, 0, 10\nLazy: 6, 6, 2, 14\nWily: 12, 8, 2, 12\n@OSRS_Wiki}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable align-left-2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=2 |Cat\n!{{SCP|Hitpoints|link=yes}}\n!{{SCP|Attack|link=yes}}\n!{{SCP|Strength|link=yes}}\n!Max Hit\n!{{SCP|Defence|link=yes}}\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Kitten|txt=Kitten|pic=Pet kitten (grey and black)}}\n|4\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Cat|txt=Cat|pic=Pet cat (grey and black)}}\n|6\n|4\n|3\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Overgrown cat|txt=Overgrown cat|pic=Pet cat (overgrown, grey and black)}}\n|10\n|3\n|5\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Wily cat|txt=Wily cat|pic=Wily cat (grey and black)}}\n|12\n|12\n|8\n|2\n|2\n|-\n|{{plinkt|Lazy cat|txt=Lazy cat|pic=Lazy cat (grey and black)}}\n|14\n|6\n|6\n|1\n|2\n|}\n\n==Quests==\n*[[Gertrude's Cat]]\n*[[Icthlarin's Little Helper]]\n*[[Ratcatchers]]\n*[[A Tail of Two Cats]]\n*[[Recipe for Disaster]] ([[Freeing Evil Dave|Evil Dave section]])\n\n==Dialogue==\n{{hastranscript|NPC}}\n\n==Changes==\n{{Subject changes header}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 7 April 2016\n|update = Hell-Rats, Fairy Rings & Perks\n|poll = \n|change = Attempted to fix a bug whereby cats occasionally tried to grow into the wrong state.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 28 May 2015\n|update = Farming & World Switcher Tweaks\n|change = West Ardougne citizens no longer say they're giving you 100 death runes if they're actually going to give you 200.\n}}\n\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 16 May 2006\n|update = Game engine upgraded!\n|change = The NPC was made invisible on the minimap.\n}}\n{{Subject changes\n|date = 26 April 2005\n|update = Desert Month Finale\n|change = *The \"Stroke\", \"Shoo-away\", and \"Chase vermin\" options were replaced with an \"Interact-with\" option. \n*A \"Talk-to\" option was added.\n}}\n{{Subject changes footer}}\n===Gallery (historical)===\n<tabber>\n2=\n{|style=\"text-align: center\" cellpadding=\"15\"\n|[[File:Pet cat (white) detail (beta).png|center|300x150px]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (white) detail.png|center|300x150px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pet cat (white) (beta).png|center]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (white).png|center]]\n|-\n|RuneScape 2<br/>Beta\n|March/April 2004 –<br/>present\n|}\n|-|\n3=\n{|style=\"text-align: center\" cellpadding=\"15\"\n|[[File:Cat (brown) (beta).png|center|300x150px]]\n|[[File:Cat (brown).png|center|300x150px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pet cat (brown) detail (beta).png|center|300x150px]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (brown) detail.png|center|300x150px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pet cat (brown) (beta).png|center]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (brown).png|center]]\n|-\n|RuneScape 2<br/>Beta\n|March/April 2004 –<br/>present\n|}\n|-|\n4=\n{|style=\"text-align: center\" cellpadding=\"15\"\n|[[File:Cat (black) (beta).png|center|300x150px]]\n|[[File:Cat (black).png|center|300x150px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pet cat (black) detail (beta).png|center|300x150px]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (black) detail.png|center|300x150px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pet cat (black) (beta).png|center]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (black).png|center]]\n|-\n|RuneScape 2<br/>Beta\n|March/April 2004 –<br/>present\n|}\n|-|\n5=\n{|style=\"text-align: center\" cellpadding=\"15\"\n|[[File:Pet cat (grey and brown) detail (beta).png|center|300x150px]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (grey and brown) detail.png|center|300x150px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pet cat (grey and brown) (beta).png|center]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (grey and brown).png|center]]\n|-\n|RuneScape 2<br/>Beta\n|March/April 2004 –<br/>present\n|}\n|-|\n6=\n{|style=\"text-align: center\" cellpadding=\"15\"\n|[[File:Pet cat (grey and blue) detail (beta).png|center|300x150px]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (grey and blue) detail.png|center|300x150px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pet cat (grey and blue) (beta).png|center]]\n|[[File:Pet cat (grey and blue).png|center]]\n|-\n|RuneScape 2<br/>Beta\n|March/April 2004 –<br/>present\n|}\n</tabber>\n\n==Trivia==\n* Attempting to cast a [[High Level Alchemy]] spell on any cat will result in a message saying, \"You can't do that to a defenceless cat!\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Pets}}"
