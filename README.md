Old School Bot uses `oldschooljs` (also made by me), for most of the OSRS related features like: simulating killing monsters, simulating clues, fetching the hiscores, checking worlds, etc. It's completely open-source and free to use.

### Setting up the bot to run locally for contributing

**To run the bot, you need the following things first: Git, NodeJS v12+, Postgres, a discord bot account**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot.git`
2. Change into the new directory: `cd oldschoolbot`
3. Install the yarn dependency: `npm install --global yarn`
4. Make a config file from the example: `cp src/config.example.ts src/config.ts`
5. Edit this new `config.ts` file, input your bot token and Postgres database details; be sure to read the comments for any additional instructions.
6. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and ensure your bot has `Privileged Gateway Intents > Server Members Intent` enabled.
7. Create a file called `.env` in your project's root directory with the content
   (change as necessary for your DB, this is known as a DSN): `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public`
8. Run `yarn` then `yarn install`
8. Run `npx prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client files and load the DSN from #6
9. Run `npx prisma db push` to create the tables on the database referenced in .env
10. Run `yarn build` - then run `yarn start`. In the future, you can type only `yarn start` to start the bot.

If you have errors or issues, you can ask us for help in the developer channel in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/ob).
