Old School Bot is a discord bot based around Old School RuneScape. It has fun and useful commands, such as showing your account stats or simulating the loot from monsters and clues. Old School Bot is free and open-source.

## Minions

Minions are a feature in Old School Bot that let you simulate playing a virtual RuneScape account in Discord. You control a minion, who you send out to do various tasks, like killing monsters for loot, completing clue scrolls, and training skills. With the loot they get, you can craft items, sell them, and trade to other real players.

You can also read the [FAQ](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/getting-started/faq/) for answers to common questions.

Minions are entirely virtual, and not in any way tradeable for real GP or real money. It's simulating the real game for fun. We strictly do not allow any bot users to break any of the official OSRS rules. Read the rules here: Old School Bot Rules

## Getting Started

**To get started, firstly read the** [**rules**](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/getting-started/rules/), then get yourself a minion by typing `/minion buy`. If your Discord account is 6 months old or older, your minion will be free. If it is between 1 and 6 months old, your minion will cost 20m. If your account is less than one month old, you are currently unable to purchase a minion as a precaution against alt accounts and bots (unless you become a patron which bypasses this restriction). To get your starting gp, you can use the `/minion daily` command every 12 hours to get a trivia question you can answer for gp and special Diango items.

Next, decide what you want to do. Skilling? PVM? Questing? Have a look around the rest of the wiki to see what you can do, and how - and just do whatever you want to do!
