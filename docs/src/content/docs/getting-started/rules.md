These are the rules of Old School Bot and Bot School Old (BSO)

_**Breaking these rules will get you banned (blacklisted) from the bot, or your bank/stats wiped.**_

1. Follow all of the Jagex/RuneScape rules and ToS. We strictly do not allow anyone breaking RuneScape rules, and will ban anyone doing so.
2. No botting/autotyping/macroing, this is also against Discord ToS.
3. No RWT. This includes ANYTHING related to RWT in the real osrs game, bot GP, or real money. You cannot buy/sell anything from OSRS and/or the bot for real money.
4. No alt accounts, you are only permitted to use the bot on 1 discord account per person, unless its an [ironman](ironman-mode.md), in which case it needs to be a permanent ironman.
5. No Exploitation of bugs to gain items/GP in an unintended way, and report any bugs of this nature ASAP.
6. No using the bot on shared accounts. You can only use the bot on YOUR accounts, not accounts which are shared or not yours.

### Player-run gambling & Loans

Player-run gambling and loans are _allowed_ but are mostly at your own risk. Anything that involves real money or RS3/OSRS GP are not allowed. Read and follow these instructions, they apply to both player-run gambling and loans. If you don't follow these basic instructions, we will not help you if you get scammed.

- Only do it with people you trust and know, or that have people who can vouch for them.
- If doing a loan, ask a few questions - if they have any unpaid loans and how they plan to pay you back. If doing a gamble, make sure they actually have the items/GP to pay if they lose.
- Before doing it, make a clear and defined agreement in writing. If it's a loan, specify terms. If it's a gamble, make sure the rules of winning are clear/agreed.
- Use common sense, think about it before you do it.

If you follow these instructions, you are unlikely to get scammed, and if you do we'll try to help you. If you don't bother to follow any of these instructions, you are likely to get scammed. In any case we will blacklist people for scamming, but make no guarantee you'll get any GP back.
