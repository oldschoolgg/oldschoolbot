title: "Randomizer"

Firstly, use `/minion buy` to buy a minion, and pick the randomization method you want to use. You cannot change your randomization method without fully resetting.

### Randomization Method

**True Random:** Every item is randomly mapped to another item, with no restrictions.

**CL to CL:** This method puts item into 3 pools, and then items within each pool are randomized only to other items in the same pool.

- Pool 1: Overall+ CL items [https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/blob/randomizer2/pool1-cl.txt](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/blob/randomizer2/pool1-cl.txt)
- Pool 2: Items not in overall+ or umbs: [https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/blob/randomizer2/pool2-cl.txt](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/blob/randomizer2/pool2-cl.txt)
- Pool 3: Items not in overall+. but are in umbs: [https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/blob/randomizer2/pool3-cl.txt](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/blob/randomizer2/pool3-cl.txt)

When you buy a minion, you get a "seed" which randomizes your "item mappings", deciding what each of your items are randomized to. Everybody has different randomizations.

Your XP gets randomized (e.g. cooking xp can become slayer xp, etc. So if you want to train slayer, you'd have to do cooking.), its different for every person.

### Commands

- For every 50 CL slots you complete, you can view the mapping of a certain item. For example, if you want a Twisted bow but not sure what item it randomizes from, you can do /randomizer unlock_item_mapping item:Twisted bow and it will show a message like this: "Rune kiteshield -> Twisted bow -> Iron arrow(p++)". This means, if you smith a rune kiteshield, you'll get a twisted bow. If you get a twisted bow from COX, you'll actually get a iron arrow(p++). You will need to unlock another 50 CL slots if you want to view another mapping.

### Relics

When you start, you can pick a relic. A relic gives you some special boost, you cannot swap after picking one. You can unlock the others at a rare chance at the end of every trip.

Relic of XP: 10% bonus xp, plus 1% in your lowest skill

Relic of Repetition: 1/3 chance to automatically repeat most trips, global 30% max trip length increase

Relic of Randomness: Twice as likely to receive a UMB, and 50% chance of one reroll when opening a UMB if its an item you already have.

Relic of Loot: Double loot on every trip (for most types) for your minion and tame.

Relic of Speed: You kill monsters 30% faster, your tame kills monsters 30% faster. Relic of Slay: Unlimited slayer task block list, and 2x slayer points.

Relic of Gambling: One time use; a 50/50 chance to either add 50 items to your cl(that aren't there already) + double the XP of your lowest skill OR remove 50 items from your cl (and from your bank), and half the XP of your highest skill.

Relic of Slaying: Unlimited slayer task block list, and 2x slayer points.

### Resetting

You can reset your **entire** account 5 times, using /randomizer reset. You will start totally fresh, but this cannot be undone, so think carefully.

### Notes

- Dungeoneering floor 1 has no skill requirements.
- The ONLY mystery box is UMBs, the other mystery boxes cannot be opened or used - UMBs drop randomly from doing any trips, but nowhere else.
- Coins and UMBs do not get randomized ever, and always stay the same.
- Questing is hugely buffed.
- All normal rules still apply (no alting/botting/etc). If you break a rule in randomizer, your OSB/BSO accounts will be punished too.
- DTD's are disabled.

### Tips

- Do every possible activity/skill you can do. Minigames, thieving, farming, clue scrolls, etc, everything.
- Buy lots of items from all the shops to see what you can get.
- Save your "view mapping" unlocks for items you really need/want.
- Train skills and figure out which skills are randomized to what.

Based on your progress, you can earn a Trophy in OSB/BSO.
