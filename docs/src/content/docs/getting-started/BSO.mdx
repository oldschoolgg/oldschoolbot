Bot School Old, also known as BSO, is an alternative version of the Old School Bot. It has fun changes, new bosses, custom pets, and more! BSO is completely separate to OSB, and nothing you do in BSO will impact your real minion in OSB.

## Invite

You can invite BSO to your server using this link: https://www.oldschool.gg/invite/bso

## Key Mechanics Changes

- Clue scrolls are stackable
- 5x XP gain
- No 200m cap on XP
- Quest points are capped at 5000, and you get 1-30 at a time
- 2x PvM speed
- Clue caskets give extra loot
- Custom bosses
- Custom items, like Mystery boxes, custom pets and master skill capes!
- Most items are tradeable

## Ironman

You’re now allowed to have a permanent BSO ironman account. To create this, you’ll have to make a new discord account and do the =ironman command. Any other commands (on new accounts) will say you need to verify some thing first, but the =ironman command will bypass this. After confirming, you now have a permanent BSO ironman account.

The BSO Iron removes the options to trade, sell, gri (GiveRandomItem), gamble and answer spawnbox/lamps.

If you want to make your current account an ironman, your ENTIRE minion profile will be reset/wiped, but you can use your main account as a permanent ironman if you wish. HOWEVER, you cannot make an alt account to be "your new main", because your main is your ironman, and you'd be breaking the rules by making an alt to be a non-iron.

## BSO Items

Some items are unique to BSO due to custom bosses, mechanic changes, and drop table changes. These can be extremely useful for everything from PvM to Skilling, and are often very rare drops.

- Mystery Boxes: There are five types of mystery box; **Tradeables, Untradeables, Equippable, Holiday, and Pet**. Each box has a roll for any item in their category that exists or has ever existed. For example, a Tradeables Mystery Box, TMB for short, can roll anything from a raw shrimps to a 3rd age pickaxe. Mystery boxes can be obtained from any activity, and when obtained from a PvM or skilling trip, you loot is doubled. For people who test new features and find bugs prior to release, there may be a special box as a reward, so make sure to `.roles tester` in the support server's #other-bots channel to be pinged when testing is live. The only items which cannot drop from these boxes are certain bso exclusives in order to preserve their rarity.

- Dwarven Equipment: Dwarven items are BSO-exclusive boost items. They are either smithed out of dwarven bars (smelted from dwarven ore dropped from dwarven crates) or dropped from the Dwarven King Goldemar. The **Dwarven Greataxe** provides a 2x speed boost to woodcutting and Wintertodt. The **Dwarven Pickaxe** provides a 2x speed boost to mining. The **Dwarven Greathammer** provides a speed 2x boost to smithing and crafting. **Dwarven Gauntlets** provide a 2x speed boost to smelting and a 3x speed boost to cooking. The **Dwarven Warhammer**, which is only dropped from King Goldemar, provides a 40% speed boost to all PvM activities. The **Dwarven Blessing** gives a 20% boost to all PVM activities, at the cost of one prayer potion(4) every 5 minutes. These can be obtained from Grandmaster caskets.

- Abyssal Equipment: Abyssal items are BSO-exclusive boost items which are dropped or have component drops from Malygos. The **Abyssal Cape** provides a 50% food consumption reduction against any bosses which require food. **Abyssal Dragon Bones** provide 5x more xp than Superior Dragon Bones, the next best prayer method. The **Abyssal Pouch** is created using a Giant Pouch and **Abyssal Thread**, and it provides a significant boost to your runecrafting speed.

- XP Lamps:
  Dailies can provide you with XP **lamps** (tiny, small, average, large, and huge) which can be placed in most skills after a short time has passed from the point of their release. These provide 20k, 50k, 100k, 1m, and 5m xp respectively. They are very rare and are used by `=lamp size lamp, skill`.

- Clues:
  Clues are stackable, _and_ there is a new tier of clue, **Grandmaster**. Grandmaster clues require you to complete 50 Master clue scrolls before you can attempt them. They have a unique drop table including some BSO exclusive items such as the **Clue Hunter Outfit** which halves time to complete clue scrolls, and the **Dwarven Blessing** which provides a 20% speed boost to all PvM activities at a cost of 1x Prayer Potion (4) per 5 minutes of the trip.

- Misc:
  The **Fish Sack** drops from the Sea Kraken and boosts fishing trip times by 9 minutes. The **Thieves’ Armband** can be obtained from any activity with the Wilvus pet equipped, it halves your chance to fail a pickpocket attempt and gives 3x pickpocket loot. The **Divine Sigil** is from Corp and has the stats of the Elysian. **Rocktail** is a custom food, healing 26HP. It can obtained from Fishing Trawler or can be fished at level 120 and cooked at level 120. **First Age** items are a new set that can be obtained from Grandmaster caskets, with each piece providing a 1% boost to all XP gained, and an extra 1% ontop with the full set.

## BSO Monsters

Some monsters and their drops are unique to BSO, and some mobs have had their drop tables slightly modified.

- King Goldemar:
  King Goldemar is a group-only boss which drops the Dwarven Warhammer as well as the materials for the smithable dwarven gear pieces. It requires crush attack and defence gear in the melee setup, and other drops are not of particular note.
