## Update 6/10/2024

We now have a new wiki at https://wiki.oldschool.gg/, and the BSO Wiki is now combined together with the OSB wiki. Many pages are out of date, I'm trying to update pages when I have time. Currently, the only way to contribute to the new wiki is by editing files in [this folder on github](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/tree/master/docs/src/content/docs).

### [[gc]]

- Added new quests: The Heart of Darkness, Death on the Isle, Meat and Greet, Ethically Acquired Antiquities. You can view information on them on the new [Quests](/osb/quests) page.
- Added Araxxor. For costs, requirements, boosts, etc, look here: [Araxxor](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/osb/monsters/#araxxor)

  - Added the collection log
  - Added [[Noxious halberd]], which can be created using the pieces dropped by Araxxor, and gives a boost to Corp.

#### Chambers of Xeric: Fake Massing

You can now do 'fake masses' of CoX, so you can mass CoX without needing other real players to join your party, which is what Nex/ToB also allow. It acts as a normal mass but checks your minion for kc and boosts. You can specify the number of fake users with the 'max_team_size' option (2 - 15).
