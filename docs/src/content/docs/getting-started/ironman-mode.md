title: "Ironman Mode"
---

You can play as an ironman, but this **resets your entire account** to a fresh start. Using the `permanent: true` flag makes your status **permanent**, meaning you will **NOT** be able to de-iron. Permanent ironmen can purchase Ironman armor.

To become an Ironman:

- [[/minion ironman]]
- [[/minion ironman permanent\:true]]

**Note:** You can have multiple ironman accounts alongside a main, but they must be set as permanent.

Trip length extension from sacrifice value is halved for ironmen â€” max +1 minute (or +3 minutes with T3 Patron) requires only 5b sacrificed (instead of 10b).

## Ironman Leaderboards

Use the `ironmen_only: true` flag to filter any leaderboard to only show ironmen: e.g., [[/lb skill\:smithing ironmen_only\:true]]
