title: "Ironman Mode"
---

You can play as an ironman, however, this will reset your entire account, to a fresh start. If you use the `permanent: true` flag, you will **NOT** be able to de-iron. If you are a permanent ironman, you can buy ironman armor.

To become an Ironman, use either of the following:

- `/minion ironman`
- `/minion ironman permanent: true`

**Note:** You're allowed to have as many ironman accounts as you wish alongside your non-ironman account. However, you are required to have them set as permanent.

Trip length extension via sacrifice value is halved for ironmen, giving the maximum 1 minute increase (or 3 minute with T3 Patron) for only 5b sacrificed rather than the usual 10b. For more info on this, please [see here](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/#minion-icons).

### Ironman Leaderboards

Any leaderboard can be filtered to only show ironmen. This is done by selecting `ironmen_only: true` at the end of any `/lb` command.
