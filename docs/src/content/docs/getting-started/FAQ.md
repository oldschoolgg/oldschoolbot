### How do I see all the things I can do with my minion?

Almost everything from OSRS is coded into the bot. Read this wiki and look through the command list.

### Where can I report bugs?

Report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug.md). Ask in the [support server](https://discord.com/invite/ob) first to confirm it's a bug.

### Where can I make suggestions for the bot?

Make feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/issues/new?labels=feature+request&template=feature.md). Search existing suggestions [here](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/issues) first.

Use the Grand Exchange: [[/ge]]

### How do I equip gear on my minion?

There are 5 setups: Melee, Range, Mage, Skilling, and Misc.  
Example: [[/gear equip gear_setup\:Melee item\:Bandos chestplate]]  
Skilling gear (e.g. Graceful) goes in your Skilling setup.  
Equip pets using: [[/gear pet equip\:Zilyana]]

Yes. Use `+cancel`. You'll lose all progress, loot, XP, and used items.

Use [[/daily]] and [[/dice]]. Or get gifted money from others.

- You're banned
