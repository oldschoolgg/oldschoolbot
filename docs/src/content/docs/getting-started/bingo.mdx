We are hosting the 3rd OSB Bingo! You can compete for a chance of winning some GP, and a guaranteed chance of getting a trophy.

## Information
- When completing tiles, the bot automatically tracks and handles it for you. Your team "shares" tiles, so if one person completes a tile, it counts for the whole team.
- Ironmen can join teams and participate, no entry free is required, but they will not be eligible for item/GP rewards.
- Each player pays a 250m entry fee (when joining a team) which goes into the prize pool.

## How to Join
1. Gather 4 friends (for a team of 5), OR find people from our server to make a team.
1. Ensure all 5 people have the 250m entry free, and are ready to confirm.
1. Use this command in the main discord server: [[/bingo make_team bingo\:OSB Bingo #3]], and everyone click the confirm button.
