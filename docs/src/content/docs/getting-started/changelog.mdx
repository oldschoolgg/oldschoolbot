- Made giveaways much more optimized, to prevent lag in big giveaways.

**Clue scrolls** have received several updates/changes in this update, view our [Clue Scrolls](/osb/clues/#implings) page for updated information.

### [[Arodab]]

- Rebalanced clue scroll speeds to more closely match OSRS rates
  - Beginner, Easy, Medium, Elite clues got a fairly significant buff (are now faster to complete)
  - Added some more boosts, see the [Clue Scrolls](/osb/clues/#boosts) page to see all boosts
  - You can now get a larger boost from your minions experience doing clues

### [[gc]]

- You can now stack clue scrolls, view the clue scrolls page for more information. Although the bot lets you stack clues in your bank, we are just emulating the mechanic of clue juggling. In other words, your minion keeps the clues in your bank juggled, allowing you to hold them - and your minion can only juggle a maximum of 100 clues. If you receive more clues while at the limit of 100 clues, your minion will drop the lowest tier ones you have to fit higher tier ones (e.g. it will drop an easy clue to pick up an elite clue).
- Boosts to clue scrolls now apply _per clue_ instead of to the entire trip, allowing you to complete more clues per trip.
- _'Engine Changes:'_ I have integrated the packages we use into the main repo as a monorepo, with the simple explanation being it makes it easier for myself and others to add new things, like bosses.
- The Pharaoh's sceptre is now tradeable

#### The Hueycoatl

[[huey.webp]]

The Hueycoatl boss can now be killed using [[/k]]!

##

We now have a new wiki at https://wiki.oldschool.gg/, and the BSO Wiki is now combined together with the OSB wiki. Many pages are out of date, I'm trying to update pages when I have time. Currently, the only way to contribute to the new wiki is by editing files in [this folder on github](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/tree/master/docs/src/content/docs).
