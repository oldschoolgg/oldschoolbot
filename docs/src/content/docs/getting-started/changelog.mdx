- Hueycoatl bug fixes: dropping less hides than it should, using no food, pet rate being too common.

- **Wiki Changes:**
  - Various improvements/fixes to the wiki
  - The [Combat Achievements](/osb/combat-achievements/) page now has an input that lets you put your discord ID, and see your combat achievements progress on the wiki. This is inspired by, and similar to, the osrs wiki leagues tasks page. If people find this useful, I will add it for other things/pages too.
  - Added a lightmode (enable it on the top right of the page)
  - The [Monsters](/osb/monsters/) page now shows some more monsters that were missing.

### [[DayV-git]]

- Fixed the hueycoatl CL notifications showing the wrong KC
- Update Gnomes, Paladins and Heros according to the [osrs update](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Project_Rebalance:_Skilling_%26_Poll_81_MTA_Changes#Pickpocketing  ), dropping med/hard/elite clues respectively. Success rates have been updated and added clues as tertiary drops.
- Fixed a bug with the rogues outfit doubling clue scrolls.
- Added wealthy citizens to [[/steal]], they have a *doubled* max trip length because they are afk.
- Clue stacking/juggling now applies properly for clues from skilling and TOB.
- Fixed a bug with a clue speed boost not being applied when it should.
- Clue trips can now be repeated if you have more clues in your bank.

### [[wontonstrips]]

fd

- Updated the minion icons wiki page

<Update date="26/11/2024" firstHash="4ccf60f038be9a7251cc7f4f9c66f4b181948ab3" secondHash="bc2e2ce8065c2edd5ca9966c9802a7df6c9da596" />

**Clue scrolls** have received several updates/changes in this update, view our [Clue Scrolls](/osb/clues/#implings) page for updated information.

### [[Arodab]]

- Rebalanced clue scroll speeds to more closely match OSRS rates
  - Beginner, Easy, Medium, Elite clues got a fairly significant buff (are now faster to complete)
  - Added some more boosts, see the [Clue Scrolls](/osb/clues/#boosts) page to see all boosts
  - You can now get a larger boost from your minions experience doing clues

### [[gc]]

- You can now stack clue scrolls, view the clue scrolls page for more information. Although the bot lets you stack clues in your bank, we are just emulating the mechanic of clue juggling. In other words, your minion keeps the clues in your bank juggled, allowing you to hold them - and your minion can only juggle a maximum of 100 clues. If you receive more clues while at the limit of 100 clues, your minion will drop the lowest tier ones you have to fit higher tier ones (e.g. it will drop an easy clue to pick up an elite clue).
- Boosts to clue scrolls now apply *per clue* instead of to the entire trip, allowing you to complete more clues per trip.
- *'Engine Changes:'* I have integrated the packages we use into the main repo as a monorepo, with the simple explanation being it makes it easier for myself and others to add new things, like bosses.
- The Pharaoh's sceptre is now tradeable

#### The Hueycoatl 
[[huey.webp]]

The Hueycoatl boss can now be killed using [[/k]]!

## 

We now have a new wiki at https://wiki.oldschool.gg/, and the BSO Wiki is now combined together with the OSB wiki. Many pages are out of date, I'm trying to update pages when I have time. Currently, the only way to contribute to the new wiki is by editing files in [this folder on github](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/tree/master/docs/src/content/docs).
