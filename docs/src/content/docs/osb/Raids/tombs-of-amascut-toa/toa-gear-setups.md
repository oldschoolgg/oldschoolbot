# ToA Gear Setups

## Preface Notes

- Equipping the Serpentine helm in your melee setup removes the need for sanfews. It only sacrifices 0.4% of your gear score. It uses 600 charges/hour, which is significantly less compared to the cost of sanfews.
- The type of arrows you use will have a minor effect on your gear score. You must use at least adamant arrows. It may be worth using rune arrows if you find yourself in short supply of dragon arrows.
- The type of darts in your blowpipe do not effect your gear score. You must use at least adamant darts. It is not recommended to use dragon darts, purely from a cost point of view.
- The Osmumten's fang is only BiS when doing Expert mode raids (300 or higher). If you are doing Entry or Normal modes, the Ghrazi rapier is BiS.

## BiS Before ToA Upgrades:

- The Sanguinesti staff can be used instead of the Kodai wand (same gear score).

## BiS After ToA Upgrades

- The following image is for Expert mode raids (300+).
- For BiS in Entry mode (0-149) or Normal mode (150-299), equip a Ghrazi rapier in melee.
