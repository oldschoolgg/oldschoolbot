title: "Chambers of Xeric (CoX)"
---

## Getting Started

There are a few things that need to be prefaced before you get started.

To view your current stats and raiding abilities (gear score and death chance), use:

- `/raid cox stats`

To start a Chambers of Xeric raid, use either:

- `/raid cox start`` `**`type:`**` ``solo`
  - Solo CoX can be completed at 0kc, however, you are heavily penalised until 50kc. After 50kc, your solo'ing ability will be increased.
- `/raid cox start`` `**`type:`**` ``mass`
  - Mass Cox requires a minimum of 2 users and has a maximum capacity of 15. Remember that one user will need 55 Farming and 78 Herblore for the mass!

---

## Requirements

- 80+ Attack/Strength/Defence/Ranged/Magic
- 70+ Prayer
- Saradomin brew(4), Super restore(4), Stamina potion(4)
- In a mass, at least one user needs 55 Farming and 78 Herblore (if solo, you need both).

It is highly recommended that you have the best possible Melee, Range and Mage gear and equip them in their respective setups. You can still participate with less than the 'best-in-slot' gear, but you will receive less points, increased raid time and increased death chance.

View the best in slot and alternate gear setups for CoX [here](cox-gear-setups.md).

## Potion Usage

When you are first starting out, you will be using 10x Saradomin brew(4), 5x Super restore(4) and 3x Stamina potion(4) per mass. They must be 4-dose potions.

- `/activities decant`` `**`potion_name:`** **`dose:`**`4`

These quantities scale based off KC, Challenge Mode and Mass/Solo. In solos, you will use one extra Stamina potion(4).

## Finding a Raid Team

In the [support discord server](http://invite.oldschool.gg/) you will find dedicated channels for Chambers of Xeric.

For chatting, asking for help with your gear score you can talk in [`#raids-general`](https://discord.com/channels/342983479501389826/835879359805653002).

For Challenge Mode chambers, solo or mass, it's recommended that you use [`#raids-mass-cm`](https://discord.com/channels/342983479501389826/835879528513142794).

For regular chambers it's recommended that you use [`#raids-mass-regular`.](https://discord.com/channels/342983479501389826/835879317418278963)

Please keep in mind that these are just recommendations, you are not restricted to these channels in order to participate in raiding, it is only recommended as finding a group would be much easier. You can raid in your own discord servers if you would like to.

## Boosts

Higher Kc makes raids faster. Here is the maximum kc that will give a boost:

| Difficulty | Solo Kc | Mass Kc |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Normal     | 250     | 400     |
| Challenge  | 75      | 100     |

Specific items will give a hidden speed boost to your raids, they **DO NOT** need to be equipped and the affect will apply from your bank.

The item with the highest boost that you currently own from each line will be applied.

- Twisted bow (8%) **OR** Bow of faerdhinen (6%) **OR** Dragon hunter crossbow (5%)
- Dragon hunter lance (3%) **OR** Abyssal tentacle (2%)
- Tumeken's shadow (9%)**\*\*\*\*** OR** Sanguinesti staff (6%)**\*\*\*\*\*
- Dragon warhammer (3%) **OR** Bandos godsword (2.5%)
- Zaryte vambraces (4%) **(must be equipped in range setup for boost)**

- Requires at least 200 charges for boost to apply.

\*\* - Requires at least 130 charges for boost to apply.

**\*\*\*** - Requires at least 150 charges for boost to apply.

## Challenge Mode

CM raids function much the same as regulars, however, they take substantially longer. Your raids will start out at around 2 hours in length, but drastically decrease as your KC gets higher. After around 75 CMs, you will have the maximum speed boost which (along with a high gear score), should make your CMs around 40-45 minutes in length.

### Requirements

- 200 regular Chambers of Xeric kill count
- Twisted bow **OR** Dragon hunter crossbow **OR** Bow of faerdhinen + full Crystal armour **(masses)**
- Twisted bow **(solos)**

### Loot

All the same loot from Old School RuneScape is available on Old School Bot.

Unique Chambers of Xeric (regular) loot can be viewed [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chambers_of_Xeric#Unique_drop_table)

See below for unique Chambers of Xeric (Challenge Mode) loot.

- Metamorphic dust - 1/400
- Twisted ancestral colour kit - 1/75

**Note:** You can receive the Challenge Mode 'Dusted' metamorphic pets too, you just need 1x Metamorphic dust in your collection log and then they are dropped at a 1/50 rate from challenge mode Chambers of Xeric raids. (You **DO NOT** need an Olmlet!)

If you or another user of your raid gets a unique, you will see a purple square next to the spoiler and the loot (excluding prayer scrolls) is recorded in the [#notifications](https://discord.com/channels/342983479501389826/469523207691436042) channel in the [discord support server](http://invite.oldschool.gg/).
