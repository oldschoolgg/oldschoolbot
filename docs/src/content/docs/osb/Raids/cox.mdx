title: "Chambers of Xeric (CoX)"
---

To view your current stats and raiding abilities (gear score and death chance), use: [[/raid cox stats]]

To start a solo raid: [[/raid cox start type\:solo]]. You can begin soloing at 0kc, however, you are heavily penalised until atleast 50 KC.

To start a mass raid with other real players: [[/raid cox start type\:mass]], you can find other players to join you in our discord server.

To start a mass with "bots/npcs" (to mass without needing others to join): [[/raid cox start type\:fakemass]]

## Requirements

- [[attack:80]] [[strength:80]] [[defence:80]] [[ranged:80]] [[magic:80]] [[prayer:70]]
- [[farming:55]] [[herblore:78]] (if massing, only one person needs these)
- [[Saradomin brew(4)]] [[Super restore(4)]]
- [[Stamina potion(4)]] (you use an extra if you're solo)
- Good gear equipped for all 3 combat styles
- Ammo for your range weapon (equipped in range setup)
- Charges for your gear (if applicable)

## Challenge Mode

CM raids function much the same as regulars, however, they take substantially longer. Your raids will start out at around 2 hours in length, but drastically decrease as your KC gets higher. After around 75 CMs, you will have the maximum speed boost which (along with a high gear score), should make your CMs around 40-45 minutes in length.

### Requirements

- 200 regular Chambers of Xeric kill count
- Twisted bow **OR** Dragon hunter crossbow **OR** Bow of faerdhinen + full Crystal armour **(masses)**
- Twisted bow **(solos)**

### Loot

Most of the loot is the same as osrs, which you can see [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chambers_of_Xeric#Unique_drop_table). However, dust/metamorph pets work differently. You can receive the Challenge Mode 'Dusted' metamorphic pets too, you just need 1x Metamorphic dust in your collection log and then they are dropped at a 1/50 rate from challenge mode Chambers of Xeric raids. (You **DO NOT** need an Olmlet!)
