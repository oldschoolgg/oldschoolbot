title: "Trip Buyables"
---

Some resources are purchased via timed buying trips that simulate hopping between in-game shops. These items use the [[/buy]] command just like other buyables, but take time to collect.

Below is a list of every trip buyable, a ready-to-copy [[/buy]] command, and the rate your minion can purchase them.
