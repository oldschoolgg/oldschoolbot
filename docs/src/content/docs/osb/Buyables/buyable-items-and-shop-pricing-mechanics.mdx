title: "Buyable Items and Shop Pricing Mechanics"
---

## Overview
Most items bought with `/buy` are delivered instantly at their listed GP price.
For some resources your minion must travel to in‑game shops. When this happens
you'll see a confirmation showing the total cost and trip duration. Accepting
the prompt sends your minion on a timed buying trip that mimics hopping between
OSRS worlds.

## Instant Buyables
Items without `shopQuantity` or `changePer` simply cost their listed `gpCost`.
The GP is removed from your bank and the items are delivered immediately, like a
virtual Grand Exchange.

## Shop Buyables
Some items come from in game shops and follow Old School RuneScape pricing rules:

- **gpCost** – base price (100%).
- **changePer** – price increase per item bought (e.g. `1` for +1%).
- **shopQuantity** – items available before world hopping.

Price increases linearly within a world and resets after each hop.

When a shop buyable is requested the bot shows a summary like
"Buying **5000 Gold ore** will cost **1,125,000gp** and take about
**27 minutes**. Continue?" Accepting sends your minion off to hop worlds and buy
the items.

Example: Arrow shafts start at 1 GP each and increase by 1% per shaft. After
buying 1000 the average price is around 5.5 GP before hopping.

```ts
price = Math.floor(basePrice * (1 + changePer / 100 * itemsBoughtInWorld))
```

Every `shopQuantity` items the minion hops to a new world and pricing starts over.

### Fields Used in Code
- `gpCost: number`
- `shopQuantity?: number`
- `changePer?: number`
- `quantityPerHour: number` – limits trip length

### Current Shop-Based Buyables
A few notable examples are:

- **Arrow shafts** – bought in bulk with rising prices.
- **Blood runes** (and other elemental runes).
- **Gold ore** and other ores sold at shops.

Most items remain simple flat-cost purchases but these shop buyables use the
`calculateShopBuyCost` function to determine total and average price while
world hopping.
