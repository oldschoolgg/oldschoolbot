You can send your minion to complete clue scrolls in your bank using [[/clue]]. For a list of clue scrolls, their rewards, and their sources, refer to the [OSRS Wiki Clues Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue_scroll).

## Clue Stacking/Juggling

In OSRS, you can "juggle" clues as a method to stack them. Your minion will stack clues in your bank up to a total maximum of 100 clues of any tier, these clues are seen as being juggled by your minion, which is what allows them to stack in your bank.

You can only have a maximum of 100 clues (all clues combined), if you receive more clues after hitting this limit, your minion will automatically drop lower tier clues to make way for higher tier clues. For example, if you have 50 Easy Clues and 50 Medium clues in your bank, you are at the limit of 100, however if your minion gets a hard clue drop, it will drop an easy clue, so it can fit the hard clue within the limit.

## Where To Get Clues

### Beginner Clues

Obor and Bryophyta for guaranteed beginners, requires [[Giant key]] and [[Mossy key]] respectively.

Alternatively can kill men or goblins for easies and beginners.

### Easy Clues

Pickpocket Male or Female HAM Members. Average easy clue takes ~1-2 minutes to obtain this way.

### Medium Clues

Puro puro is 330 eclectics/hr at high level, resulting in a medium clue every ~5 minutes for time spent.

Killing guards with a cannon is an alternative for slightly slower meds/hour.

### Hard Clues

As many hard clues come passively, doing slayer with a good [blocklist](/osb/skills/slayer/readme/#recommended-blockskip-list) is the recommended way to obtain hard clues, as superiors will result in quite a few totem pieces for the guaranteed hard clues from skotizo. If you'd rather not do slayer, the best method for hard clues/hr is to barrage Warped Jellies.

### Elite Clues

Elite clues generally come passively through pvm, as virtually every boss drops elite clues. Barrows is the best pure elite clues per hour at roughly 1 every hour with all boosts, closely followed by Sarachnis which also drops hard clues.

### Master Clues

Master clues can be created using an easy, medium, hard, and elite clue scroll: [[/create item\:Master clue]]. However, this is generally not recommended, as getting masters passively through other clue completions is a much more efficient way to obtain them.

## Implings

It is possible to run multiple clues in one trip using banked implings, your minion will complete a clue, then open jars during the trip to do more clues. You can select your desired clue type, and then the tier of impling which you wish to use. For example: [[/clue tier\:Medium implings\:Eclectic impling jar]]
