You can send your minion to complete clue scrolls in your bank using [[/clue]]. For a list of clue scrolls, their rewards, and their sources, refer to the [OSRS Wiki Clues Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue_scroll).

## Clue Stacking/Juggling

In OSRS, you can "juggle" clues as a method to stack them. Your minion will stack clues in your bank up to a total maximum of 100 clues of any tier. These clues are seen as being juggled by your minion, which is what allows them to stack in your bank.

You can only have a maximum of 100 clues (all clues combined). If you receive more clues after hitting this limit, your minion will automatically drop lower-tier clues to make way for higher-tier clues. For example, if you have 50 Easy clues and 50 Medium clues in your bank, you are at the limit of 100. However, if your minion gets a Hard clue drop, it will drop an Easy clue so it can fit the Hard clue within the limit.

## Where to Get Clues

### Beginner Clues

- Obor and Bryophyta provide guaranteed Beginner clues, which require a [[Giant key]] and [[Mossy key]], respectively.

- Alternatively, you can kill men or goblins for Easy and Beginner clues.

### Easy Clues

- Pickpocket Male or Female HAM Members. The average Easy clue takes approximately 1–2 minutes to obtain this way.

### Medium Clues

- Puro-Puro yields about 330 Eclectic implings per hour at high level, resulting in a Medium clue every ~5 minutes for time spent.

- Killing guards with a cannon is an alternative for slightly slower Medium clues per hour.

### Hard Clues

- As many Hard clues come passively, doing Slayer with a good [blocklist](/osb/skills/slayer/readme/#recommended-blockskip-list) is the recommended way to obtain Hard clues, as superiors will result in quite a few totem pieces for the guaranteed Hard clues from Skotizo. 

- If you'd rather not do Slayer, the best method for Hard clues per hour is to barrage Warped Jellies.

### Elite Clues

- Elite clues generally come passively through PvM, as virtually every boss drops Elite clues. Sarachnis is now the best pure Elite clues per hour, yielding roughly 1.2 Elite clues per hour with maximum boosts (about 71 kills per hour at a 1/60 drop rate) and also providing Hard clues; Barrows remains a solid alternative at roughly one Elite clue per hour.

### Master Clues

- Master clues can be created using an Easy, Medium, Hard, and Elite clue scroll: [[/create item\:Master clue]]. However, this is generally not recommended, as getting Masters passively through other clue completions is a much more efficient way to obtain them.

## Implings

It is possible to run multiple clues in one trip using banked implings. Your minion will complete a clue, then open jars during the trip to do more clues. You can select your desired clue type and then the tier of impling you wish to use. For example: [[/clue tier\:Medium implings\:Eclectic impling jar]].
