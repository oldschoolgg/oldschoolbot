# Combat Skills

While strength can be leveled through barbarian fishing and magic has various non-combat applications, PvM can be a more efficient and profitable way to level up your combat stats. By using the `+m train` command, you can select which style of combat you would like to level. You can leave this in the default mode where your style will change depending on the mob you are attacking, or you can specify a specific combat skill to train in (eg. `+m train attack` to level attack or `+m train shared` to train defence, attack, and strength). The amount of xp you gain is based off of the hitpoints of the monster you're killing, and the hourly rate can vary from monster to monster. Fire giants offer the fastest combat experience in the game, but their lack of profitable drops can mean it may be preferable to train on other monsters.

Hitpoints experience is gained alongside any combat and cannot be selected as a primary training focus.
