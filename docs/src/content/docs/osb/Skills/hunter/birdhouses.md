# Birdhouses

Birdhouses are a great way to collect birds nests and various seeds and rings. It is also the only method to collect bird's eggs for the chance at the evil chicken outfit pieces. All birdhouses take the same amount of time (50 minutes).

If you are tier 1 patron or higher (and your BH's are ready), you will see a **'Birdhouse Run'** button at the end of your trips. This can be enabled/disabled using:

`/config user toggle`` `**`name:`**`Disable Birdhouse Run Button`

---

## Commands

If you have no birdhouses in place, you can set them up using:

- `/activities birdhouses`` `**`action:`**`Collect and Plant Birdhouses`` `**`birdhouse:`**

To check to see if your birdhouses are ready, use:

- `/activities birdhouses`` `**`action:`**`Check Birdhouses`

To favourite a specific seed to use on your birdhouse runs, use:

- `/config user favorite_bh_seeds`

## Boosts

- 10% for full graceful equipped in any setup

## Odds Of Each Nest Type

You have a 50/50 chance at hitting the nest table when dismantling each birdhouse. If you hit the table, you then receive a random amount of nests, depending on the birdhouse tier.

|                     |                          |
| ------------------- | :----------------------: |
| **Birdhouse**       | **Possible Nest Amount** |
| Bird house          |            1             |
| Oak bird house      |           1-2            |
| Willow bird house   |           1-3            |
| Teak bird house     |           1-4            |
| Maple bird house    |           1-5            |
| Mahogany bird house |           1-6            |
| Yew bird house      |           1-7            |
| Magic bird house    |           1-8            |
| Redwood bird house  |           1-9            |

There are 3 nest types you can receive, and each of these has a weighting which determines your chances of receiving each one. Wearing a [rabbit foot necklace](./#rabbit-foot-necklace) will slightly increase the amount of egg and ring nests received. They are:

- Egg nests (3%)
- Ring nests (32%)
- Seed nests (65%)

Clue scrolls are also given as a tertiary drop. Each tier (except beginner) has a 1/200 chance to be received per birdhouse. Weirdly, if you don't receive any clues from the initial roll, you have a 1/1000 chance for a beginner.

## Bird Eggs

These can be offered to the shrine where you have a chance at receiving pieces of the Evil chicken outfit. Each piece is 1/300 chance, and there is no set order in which you receive the pieces of the oufit.

To offer the eggs, use `/offer`` `**`name:`**` ``[colour] bird egg`

**NOTE:** You will receive 100 prayer xp per egg offered.

As of 23rd Oct 2022, tracking was added to view the amount of eggs offered. Tracking only tracks the eggs offered after this date. To view how many you have offered, use:

- `/data`` `**`name:`**` ``Bird Eggs Offered`
