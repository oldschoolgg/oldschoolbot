Birdhouses are a great way to collect bird nests, seeds, and rings. It is also the only method to collect bird eggs, which give a chance at pieces of the Evil Chicken outfit. All birdhouses take the same amount of time (50 minutes).

If you are a tier 1 patron or higher (and your birdhouses are ready), you will see a **Birdhouse Run** button at the end of your trips. This can be enabled or disabled with:  
[[/config user toggle name\:Disable Birdhouse Run Button]]

## Commands

If no birdhouses are in place, you can set them up with:  
[[/activities birdhouses action\:Collect and Plant Birdhouses birdhouse\:]]

To check if your birdhouses are ready:  
[[/activities birdhouses action\:Check Birdhouses]]

To favorite a specific seed for your birdhouse runs:  
[[/config user favorite_bh_seeds]]

## Rewards

Birdhouse runs can yield:

- Bird nests – higher tiers yield more
- Feathers – 10 to 100 from any tier
- Raw bird meat – 1 to 5 depending on tier
- Ring jewellery – sapphire to diamond (lower tiers more common)
- Seeds – only tree and fruit tree seeds
- Bird eggs – all colours equally likely
- Clue scrolls – beginner to elite

## Odds of Each Nest Type

You have a 50/50 chance of hitting the nest table when dismantling a birdhouse. If successful, you then get a random amount of nests, based on the birdhouse tier.

| **Birdhouse**       | **Nest Amount** |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Bird house          | 1               |
| Oak bird house      | 1–2             |
| Willow bird house   | 1–3             |
| Teak bird house     | 1–4             |
| Maple bird house    | 1–5             |
| Mahogany bird house | 1–6             |
| Yew bird house      | 1–7             |
| Magic bird house    | 1–8             |
| Redwood bird house  | 1–9             |

Nest types:

- Egg nests – 3%
- Ring nests – 32%
- Seed nests – 65%

Wearing a [Rabbit Foot Necklace](./#rabbit-foot-necklace) slightly increases egg and ring nest odds.

Clue scrolls are a tertiary drop:

- Elite/master/hard/medium/easy: 1/200 each per birdhouse
- If none of the above hit, beginner clue has 1/1000 chance
