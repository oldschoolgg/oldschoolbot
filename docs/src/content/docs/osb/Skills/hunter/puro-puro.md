## Dark Lure Spell

You can choose to use the Dark Lure spell when attempting to catch All or High-Tier Implings. It does not work for anything else, as you're effectively spawn camping the lower-tier implings. The spell also has its own set of requirements. You must also have a set number of death and nature runes in your bank. Equipping a Bryophyta's staff gives a 1/15 chance to save a nature rune while using the Dark Lure spell.

- _When hunting All Implings, you need a minimum of 300 death and 300 nature runes._
  - You will have a boosted chance of catching Nature imps and above.
- _When hunting High-Tier Implings, you need a minimum of 100 death and 100 nature runes._
  - You will have a 20% increased chance of catching implings.

The requirements to use the spell are:

- 9 Quest Points
- [[agility:54]]
- [[thieving:52]]
- [[woodcutting:52]]
- [[magic:50]]
- [[herblore:50]]
- [[mining:42]]
- [[crafting:38]]
- [[strength:16]]
- [[hunter:12]]
