Herbiboar is a hunter activity where you can gain decent hunter XP and a handful of herbs. With maximum boosts at level 99 hunter, you can expect to see around 155–160k XP/h, with a sprinkle of 1–4k herb XP/h.

To start Herbiboar, use: [[/hunt name\:Herbiboar]]

Stamina potions can be used with the flag [[/hunt name\:Herbiboar stamina_potions\:true]]. For every 9 minutes of your trip, you will consume a full 4-dose stamina.

**Herbiboar trip times work differently than other creatures.** Instead of catching more creatures for using stamina potions, you will instead catch the same amount of creatures in a shorter time period.

## Requirements

- [[hunter:80]]
- [[herblore:31]]

## Boosts

- 5% for full Graceful (equipped in any setup)
- 20% for using Stamina potions

  - Grimy Guam Leaf
  - Grimy Irit Leaf

  - Grimy Kwuarm
