# Herbiboar

Herbiboar is a hunter activity where you can gain decent hunter xp and a handful of herbs. With maximum boosts at level 99 hunter, you can expect to see around 155-160k xp/h per hour, with a sprinkle of 1-4k herb xp/h.

To start Herbiboar, use:

- `/hunt`` `**`name:`**`Herbiboar`

Stamina potions can be used with the flag **`stamina_potions:`**`true`. For every 9 minutes of your trip, you will consume a full 4-dose stamina.

- `/hunt`` `**`name:`**`Herbiboar`` `**`stamina_potions:`**` ``true`

**Herbiboar trip times work different to other creatures.** Instead of catching more creatures for using stamina potions, you will instead catch the same amount of creatures in a shorter time period.
