# Crystal Implings

You can specifically hunt Crystal implings at a much faster rate than passively collecting them through activities completed in Priff. This method is limited to catching 22 Crystal imps per hour (compared to the 1 Crystal imp every 1-2 hours through passive activities). This does not mean you will catch 22 Crystal imps per hour, it's just the maximum. You are more likely to catch 12-18 per hour.

## Requirements

- 150 Quest points
- Song of the Elves requirements
  - 70 Mining, Smithing, Farming, Woodcutting, Agility, Herblore, Construction, Hunter

## Boosts

Boosts affect your chance of a successful catch, rather than the speed of your trip. Basically, higher boosts means increased imp catches.

- 5% boost for Graceful outfit **(must be equipped anywhere)**
- 20% boost for using Stamina potion(4) _(1 stam every 10 mins of the trip)_
- Up to 10% for creature hunting experience _(1% for every hour of hunting)_
- \+2 Hunter levels if using Hunter potion(4) _(1 hunt pot every 8 mins of the trip)_
