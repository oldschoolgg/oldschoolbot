## Passive Implings

As your minion is on a trip, it will automatically catch any implings it finds, provided it has the hunter level to catch them with a net (you don't actually need to buy a net).

You can view the collection log for implings with [[/cl name\:implings]].

## How It Works

There is a 1/85 chance of your minion finding an impling _every minute of your trip_, provided your trip is over 4 minutes in length and you're not completing the Fight Caves, Inferno, ToB, ToA, or some minigames (Barb Assault, Castle Wars, LMS, PC, Puro-Puro, Drift Net, Underwater fish/agil).

When you successfully roll the 1/85, the given impling is determined by a weighting. If you have [[hunter:89+]], the total of all weightings is 349. This means that each impling (except crystal) has a X/349 chance to be caught _if_ you roll the 1/85, X being the specific weighting of each impling type. If you don't have [[hunter:89]], subtract the weighting of the imps you don't have access to from the total weighting (349).

For example, assuming you have [[hunter:89+]], and you receive 1x Baby impling during your 30-minute trip—that means you had 30 rolls at the 1/85 chance to find an impling, and you successfully rolled it once. The weight of a Baby impling is 66. That means, you then rolled the 66/349 chance for a Baby impling.

The odds of catching a Baby imp every minute are 1/449 (the math is: 1/85 × 66/349). Theoretically, you have about a 1/15 chance to catch a Baby imp every 30 minutes.

The chance of catching a Lucky impling is 1/29,665 every minute (1/989 every 30 minutes).

- Gauntlet
- Zalcano
- Killing Dark beasts or Elves
- Pickpocketing Elves
- Training at Prifddinas rooftop course

**Crystal implings** have a static 1/155 catch chance every minute. This equates to about a 1/5 chance to catch a Crystal impling every 30 minutes.
