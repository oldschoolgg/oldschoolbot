# Passive Implings

As your minion is on a trip, it will automatically catch any implings it finds, provided it has the hunter level to catch them with a net (you don't actually need to buy a net).

You can view the collection log for implings with `/clname:implings`.

## How It Works

There is a 1/85 chance of your minion finding an impling _every minute of your trip_, provided your trip is over 4 minutes in length and you're not completing the Fight caves, Inferno, ToB, ToA, or some minigames (Barb assault, Castle wars, LMS, PC, Puro puro, Drift net, Underwater fish/agil).

When you successfully roll the 1/85, the given impling is determined by a weighting. If you have 89+ hunter, the total of all weightings is 349. This means that each impling (except crystal) has a X/349 chance to be caught _if_ you roll the 1/85, X being the specific weighting of each impling type. If you don't have 89 hunter, minus the weighting of the imps you don't have access to, from the total weighting (349).

For example, (assuming you have 89+ hunter) you receive 1x Baby impling during your 30 minute trip. That means, you had 30 rolls at the 1/85 chance to find an impling, and you successfully rolled it once during your trip. The weight of a Baby impling is 66. That means, you then rolled the 66/349 chance for a Baby impling.

The odds of catching a Baby imp every minute are 1/449 (the maths is: 1/85 x 66/349). Theoretically, you have about a 1/15 chance to catch a Baby imp every 30 minutes.

The chance of catching a Lucky impling is 1/29,665 every minute (1/989 every 30 mins).
