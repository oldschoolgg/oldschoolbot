title: "Construction"
---

Construction in the bot has three distinct parts: [Training](./#training), [Mahogany Homes](mahogany-homes.md), and your [Player-owned House](mahogany-homes.md). Mahogany Homes requires planks and steel bars, and building things in your PoH requires planks as well as various mob drops or buyables.

You can also [[/offer name\:curved bone]] and [[/offer name\:long bone]] you get from PvM for construction XP after level [[construction:30]]. Fighting the Wintertodt also provides a small amount of construction XP.

## Fastest Route to 99:

1. [[/build name\:Crude wooden chair quantity\:5]]
2. [[/build name\:Wooden bookcase quantity\:7]]
3. [[/build name\:Wooden larder quantity\:7]]
4. [[/build name\:Repair bench quantity\:3]]
5. [[/build name\:Crafting table 1 quantity\:12]]
6. [[/build name\:Oak dining table quantity\:39]]
7. [[/build name\:Carved oak table quantity\:10]]
8. [[/build name\:Oak larder quantity\:220]]
9. [[/build name\:Mahogany table]]

**Materials Needed:**  
94 Plank  
2,030 Oak plank  
92,220 Mahogany plank

### Mahogany Homes

A much cheaper alternative, especially for ironmen, is Mahogany Homes. This automatically chooses the highest tier contract you have the level for and gives much more XP per plank, at the cost of lower XP/hr.

Doing expert contracts (70+ Construction) provides roughly 180k XP/hr and gives ~390 XP per Mahogany plank used, meaning [[construction:99]] would take about 30â€“35k planks instead of 92k.

Commands:

- [[/minigames mahogany_homes start]]
- [[/minigames mahogany_homes buy]]

See the [Mahogany Homes](/osb/activities/mahogany-homes/) page for full details.

## Making Planks

There are three methods for making planks: Sawmill, Demon butler, or Plank-make spell.

| **Plank Type** | **Sawmill/Butler Cost** | **Plank-Make Spell Cost** |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Plank          | 100                     | 70                        |
| Oak Plank      | 250                     | 175                       |
| Teak Plank     | 500                     | 350                       |
| Mahogany Plank | 1500                    | 1050                      |

#### Sawmill

- [[/activities plank_make action\:Sawmill type\:[Plank type]]]
- 10% trip time boost with full Graceful
- 10% trip time boost from Woodcutting Guild (requires [[woodcutting:60]] and 50 QP)

#### Butler

- [[/activities plank_make action\:Demon Butler type\:[Plank type]]]
- ~2x faster than sawmill but more expensive and requires teleport runes
- Wearing a Crafting or Construction cape reduces rune costs

#### Plank-make Spell

- [[/activities cast spell\:Plank Make [log type]]]
- Slowest method but 30% cheaper plank cost
- ~158k Magic XP per hour

## Training

Standard training offers the fastest Construction XP and uses the most planks. These builds do not appear in your PoH and currently serve no functional purpose beyond XP. Use [[/build name\:[item]]] to train.
