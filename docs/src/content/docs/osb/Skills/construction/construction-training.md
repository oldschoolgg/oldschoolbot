## Fastest Route to 99:

`/build`` `**`name:`**`Crude wooden chair`` `**`quantity:`**`5`\
`/build`` `**`name:`**`Wooden bookcase`` `**`quantity:`**`7`\
`/build`` `**`name:`**`Wooden larder`` `**`quantity:`**`7`\
`/build`` `**`name:`**`Repair bench`` `**`quantity:`**`3`\
`/build`` `**`name:`**`Crafting table 1`` `**`quantity:`**`12`\
`/build`` `**`name:`**`Oak dining table`` `**`quantity:`**`39`\
`/build`` `**`name:`**`Carved oak table`` `**`quantity:`**`10`\
`/build`` `**`name:`**`Oak larder`` `**`quantity:`**`220`\
`/build`` `**`name:`**`Mahogany table`

**Materials Needed:** \
94 Plank\
2030 Oak plank\
92,220 Mahogany plank

### Mahogany Homes

A much cheaper alternative, especially for ironmen, is Mahogany Homes. This will automatically choose the highest tier contract you have the level for, and gives much more xp per plank, at the cost of lower xp/hr. Doing expert contracts (70+ Construction) provides roughly 180k xp/hr and gives approximately 390 xp per Mahogany plank used, which means 99 Con would take about 30-35k planks instead of 92k.\
