# Agility

You can train Agility using `+laps [quantity] <course>`, for example `+laps 10 canifis`.

Agility rewards you with marks of grace which you can use to buy Graceful equipment, using the command `+create graceful` or `+create graceful (piece)`.[

## Hallowed Sepulchre

You can now challenge the Hallowed Sepulchre and unlock the Dark Graceful outfit, the Dark Squirrel recolor, and the Ring of Endurance, as well as the other [unqiue and useful items](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hallowed_Sepulchre) provided by this minigame! You can get started by using the `+sepulchre` command, with a base agility level of 52 being required. The rewards increase the higher level floor you can reach, as will the number of hallowed marks you will obtain.

Items from the sepulchre shop can speed up your performance, as well as the Strange Old Lockpick and the Ring of Endurance, both of which are obtainable from the sepulchre itself and provide respective boosts of 1% and 4%.

| Floor | Level Required |
| :---- | :------------- |
| 1     | 52             |
| 2     | 62             |
| 3     | 72             |
| 4     | 82             |
| 5     | 92             |

## Hallowed Sepulchre Shop

The following items can be purchased using the `+buy` command using hallowed marks. Many of these items provide a boost to your performance in the sepulchre.

The dark graceful set can be made using the `+buy dark graceful` piece command with the base graceful item and a dark dye in your bank. If you have obtained a Giant Squirrel agility pet, you can `+buy dark squirrel` if you have the pet and the dark acorn in your bank to transmogrify the pet.

## Ape Atoll/Monkey Backpacks

When completing laps of the Ape Atoll agility course you can earn a [monkey backpack](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ape_Atoll_Agility_Course)! These are obtained automatically whenever you reach the lap count required for each backpack.

| Monkey Backpack | Required Lap Count |
| :-------------- | :----------------- |
| Karamjan        | 100                |
| Zombie          | 250                |
| Maniacal        | 500                |
| Skeleton        | 1,000              |

| Princely        | 2,000              |

To view your total lap counts on all agility courses, you can use the `+lapcount` command \(note: only displays laps completed since August 3rd, 2020\).

## Brimhaven

An alternative form of agility training is to use the `+agilityarena`. While your minion will take some time to learn the ins and outs of the agility arena, this minigame can be quite rewarding, providing agility arena tickets which can be turned in for additional agility xp, a graceful recolour, herbs, and even a Pirate's hook! If you have the stats for the Karamja Medium diary, your xp from obstacles and from turning in tickets will be increased by 10%. If you have the stats for the Karamja Elite diary, you will get 10% more tickets from the minigame.

You can spend your tickets on the items below using the `+aa buy` item command.

| Reward                         | Arena Ticket Cost | XP Per Ticket |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------ |
| Agility XP                     | 1                 | 240           |
| Agility XP                     | 25                | 260           |
| Agility XP                     | 1,000             | 320           |
| Toadflax                       | 3                 | N/A           |

| Pirate's Hook                  | 800               | N/A           |
