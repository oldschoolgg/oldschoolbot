1. After selecting your "Favorite alchable items" (favalchs), start a laps trip with `alch:True`, for example: [[/laps name\:Ardougne Rooftop Course alch\:True]]

It will pick the highest alch-value item from your list of favorites to alch.

## Graceful

Rooftop agility courses reward the player with marks of grace which can be used to buy pieces of the Graceful outfit (260 marks for full outfit). You can also purchase Amylase packs which will give you 100 amylase crystals per amylase pack, costing 10 marks of grace each.

To create full graceful in 1 command or buy pieces individually:

- [[/create item\:Graceful]]
- [[/create item\:Graceful (piece)]]

To buy Amylase crystals (1 quantity = 100 crystals): [[/buy name\: Amylase pack]]

## Monkey backpacks

When completing laps of the Ape Atoll agility course you can earn a [monkey backpack](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ape_Atoll_Agility_Course)! These are obtained automatically whenever you reach the lap count required for each backpack. You cannot perform alchs while running the Ape Atoll course, due to your minion holding a greegree.
