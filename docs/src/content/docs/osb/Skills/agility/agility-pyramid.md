# Agility Pyramid

If you're wanting to make some gp while running agility, this is your place. Each successfully completed lap gives 10k gp, while also allowing you to alch during your trip.

## Requirements

- 30 Agility (40+ recommended)

## Fail Rates

Even though you can start at level 30, it is recommended to wait until at least 40 agility to start training here. Here are the fail rates:

- Below level 40 - 95% fail chance
- Below level 50 - 30% fail chance
- Below level 60 - 20% fail chance
- Below level 75 - 5% fail chance
- Above level 75 - 0% fail chance

## Xp/Hour

The base xp for completing one lap is 722xp. However, depending on your agility level, and the amount of failures you endure throughout your trip, the xp can slightly vary.

The formula for a perfect lap at the agility pyramid is `722 + (300 + (AgilLvl * 8))`

- Level 30 - 19k
- Level 40 - 31k
- Level 50 - 37k
- Level 60 - 43k
- Level 70 - 45k
- Level 80 - 47k
- Level 90 - 50k
- Level 99 - 52k
