### Brimhaven Graceful Set

- To create a full set of Brimhaven graceful, use the following command:
  - `/minigames agility_arena recolor`
- This requires 250 agility arena tickets and a full set of the original graceful.
- The set cannot be created piece by piece, rather it is created entirely in 1 command.
- It also cannot be reverted back to the original graceful so it is advised to keep this set for last if you are wanting to complete all graceful sets.
