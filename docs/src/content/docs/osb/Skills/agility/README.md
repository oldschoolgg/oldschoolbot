# Agility

## Training Methods

Agility can be trained by using the command `/laps`` `**`name:`**`[course]`` `**`quantity:`**`[quantity]`` `**`alch:`**`[True/False]`

Total lap counts can be checked with `/data`` `**`name:`**` ``Personal Agility Stats`

### Rooftop Agility

Rooftop agility courses reward the player with marks of grace which can be used to buy pieces of the Graceful outfit (260 marks for full outfit). You can also purchase Amylase packs which will give you 100 amylase crystals per amylase pack, costing 10 marks of grace each.

To create full graceful in 1 command or buy pieces individually:

- `/create`` `**`item:`**` ``Graceful`
- `/create`` `**`item:`**` ``Graceful (piece)`

To buy Amylase crystals (1 quantity = 100 crystals)

- `/buy`` `**`name:`**` ``Amylase pack`

### [Hallowed Sepulchre](hallowed-sepulchre.md)

From level 52 agility, the player may train agility using the command `/minigames sepulchre start`, which also requires full Graceful equipped in your skilling setup. You will progressively get better at plundering the sepulchre as your agility level increases, peaking at 92 agility.

### [Brimhaven Agility Arena](brimhaven-agility-arena.md)

The Brimhaven Agility Arena rewards the player with Agility tickets which can be used to purchase cosmetic rewards or agility XP, using the command `/minigames agility_arena start`.

### [Agility Pyramid](agility-pyramid.md)

Starting at 30 agility, you can train agility here while making some gp on the side. Each successful lap gives 10k gp, however, the fail rate is substantially higher below level 40 agility.

### [Underwater Agility](../thieving/underwater-training.md)

You can train your agility here starting at any level (will influence xp/hr though) and collect Mermaid tears to spend at the shop. Can be combined with thieving training for big xp/hr.
