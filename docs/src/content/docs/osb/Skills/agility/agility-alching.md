# Agility Alching

You can alch items while training Agility. You select items to be alched, and then set the **`alch:`** option to `True` in the `/laps` command.

1. Select all the items you want to be alched while training:
   - `/config user favorite_alchs`` `**`add:`**` ``Rune platebody`
2. After selecting one, or lots, of "Favorite alchable items" (favalchs), simply start a laps trip with **`alch:`**`True`, for example:
   - `/laps`` `**`name:`**`Ardougne Rooftop Course`` `**`alch:`**`True`

It will pick the highest alch-value item from your list of favorites to alch.
