- If you have obtained a Giant Squirrel agility pet, you can `/buy`` `**`name:`**` ``Dark squirrel` after purchasing the dark acorn from the shop to transmogrify the pet. Be advised that you **CANNOT**revert the dark squirrel.

## Mysterious Pages

There are 5 pages in total, one for each floor. These pages are given at a 1/10 chance when completing a floor. You cannot get duplicates (unless you obtained more than 1 in the same trip you first obtained the page).

## Dark Graceful Set

You **cannot** revert Dark graceful! If you are trying to obtain all graceful sets, it is advised to leave this set until last!

- The dark graceful set can be acquired through purchasing the dark dye from the shop. It requires a full set of the base graceful and 1 dark dye per piece.
- To create the set, simply type:
  - `/create`` `**`item:`**`Dark graceful [piece]` - piece by piece
  - `/create`` `**`item:`**`Dark graceful` - whole set in one command
- You need 6 dark dyes to create the full set, totaling 1800 hallowed marks.

## **Strange Old Lockpick**

The strange old lockpick provides boosts to several places in the bot; namely Barrows and Hallowed Sepulchre, as it has a purpose in those locations in game. However, unlike its in-game counterpart, the strange old lockpick is **untradeable** in the bot, and has **infinite charges**. Because of this, its drop rate is significantly lower than in game, increasing its rarity.

| **Floor** | **Drop Rate** |
| --------- | :-----------: |
| Floor 1   |    1/2,000    |
| Floor 2   |    1/1,500    |
| Floor 3   |    1/1,100    |
| Floor 4   |     1/800     |
| Floor 5   |     1/600     |

- These rates are calculated **by chest**, not by floor. The number of chests on each floor can be found [here](<https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Coffin_(Hallowed_Sepulchre)#Locations>), on the OSRS wiki. This means that while doing the Hallowed Sepulchre at 92+ agility, you will have an approximately 1/150 chance of receiving a strange old lockpick each lap.

## Ring of Endurance

The Ring of endurance also provides boosts to several activities within the bot. Some activities require a charged version, while others only require the uncharged version.

**Once the ring is charged, it CANNOT be reverted or traded!**

To create the charged Ring of endurance, use the following command:

- `/create`` `**`item:`**`Ring of endurance`
  - Requires 125 Stamina potion(4)

The boosts apply to the following activities:

- Runecrafting trips - 1% _(**must be charged**)_ **(works from bank)**
- Underwater agility - 6% _(uncharged or charged)_ **(works from bank)**
- Drift net fishing - 6% _(uncharged or charged)_ **(works from bank)**
- Farming trips - 10% _(**must be charged**)_ **(works from bank)**
