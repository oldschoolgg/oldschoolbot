# Fountain of Rune

You can use the Fountain of Rune to charge Rings of wealth and Amulets of glory. Be aware that there is a small chance of getting pked (approximately 1/100 chance) which will result in a loss of an invent of wealths/glories per death. You will not lose any gear in any setup from this.

To charge at the Fountain of Rune, use the following command:

- `/activities charge`` `**`item:`**`[Amulet of glory/Ring of wealth]`

**Note:** quantity refers to 1 inventory (1 invent = 26 items)

### Charging Wealths

- Ring of wealth (5) are required to make the Ornate jewellery box in your POH.
- This is currently the only method to obtain charged Rings of wealth.

### Charging Glories

- Amulet of glory(6) are only used in the [Gnome Restaurant](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/gnome-restaurant) minigame.
- Gnome Restaurant is currently the only way to remove charges from a glory.
- If you want to create Amulet of glory(4), use the `/activities cast spell:recharge glory` command. However, these are not used in Gnome restaurant and are only used to create the Ornate jewelley box in your POH.
