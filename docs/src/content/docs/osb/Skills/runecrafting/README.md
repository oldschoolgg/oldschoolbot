# Runecrafting

You can train Runecrafting using `/runecraft`.

## Boosts

There are several boosts available which apply to all runes except blood and soul runes. You can view the boosts for blood and soul runes on the [Dark Altar page](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/runecrafting/dark-altar). The true blood altar uses the same boosts as regular runecrafting.

- 5% for 60+ Agility **OR** 10% for 90+ Agility
- 10% for Graceful (equipped in any setup)
- 1% for [Ring of endurance](../agility/hallowed-sepulchre.md#ring-of-endurance) **(works from bank**\*\* \*\*\*\*but must be charged)\*\*
- 3% for Runecrafting cape
- 3% for Ring of the elements **(Combination runes only)**

## Pouches

You can create Runecrafting pouches using `/create`. Similarly to in-game, higher tier pouches also require higher Runecrafting levels to use. These boost the amount of essence you can carry in 1 inventory, increasing XP/Hr.

| **Pouch**      | **Rc'ing Lvl Required To Use** |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Small Pouch    | 1                              |
| Medium Pouch   | 25                             |
| Large Pouch    | 50                             |
| Giant Pouch    | 75                             |
| Colossal Pouch | 85 + 56 Crafting               |

- Requires an Abyssal needle and one of each lower tier pouch to create.

## Multiple Runes

Just like in OSRS, certain levels will grant you multiple of regular runes. Combination runes are never multiplied.

## Combination Runes

**Note for Lava runes ONLY:**You can use the **`usestams:`**`False` option to send your minion runecrafting without using stamina potions. However, you will runecraft 3x slower than usual.

It's recommended to equip a staff in your skilling setup to provide infinite runes, for example a fire staff when crafting lava runes.

|          |                    |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| **Rune** | **Required Level** |
| Mist     | 6                  |
| Dust     | 10                 |
| Mist     | 13                 |
| Smoke    | 15                 |
| Steam    | 19                 |
| Lava     | 23                 |

## Tiaras

Crafting tiaras are a method of runecrafting training, albeit an incredibly slow method. Tiaras don't have any use within the bot, except for being stored in [STASH units](../construction/stash-units.md). They can be created through the `/runecraft` command.

Tiaras don't have any level requirements for creating them. However, some tiaras including Cosmic, Death, Law & Wrath tiaras need 5, 10, 10 & 200qp respectively.
