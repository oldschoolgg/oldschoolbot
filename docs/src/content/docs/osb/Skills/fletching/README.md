# Fletching

You can train Fletching with the `/fletch` command. For example, `/fletch`` `**`name:`**`Adamant dart`` `**`quantity:`**`10000`. To start off training Fletching, you will want to `/chop` some logs for arrow shafts, and then `/fletch`` `**`name:`**`arrow shaft` them into arrow shafts. Alternatively, you can buy logs or unfinished fletching supplies from the #grand-exchange channel in the support server.

To see all the items you can fletch, check out the [Fletching Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fletching) - most of the items found there are fletchable in the bot, having the exact same level and item requirements.
