---

Look no further for amazing smithing xp and a use for those stacked up bars! You don't need to buy moulds or make specific swords for Kovac, just choose a metal and send your minion on their way.

To start a trip of Giant's Foundry, use:

- `/minigames giants_foundry start name:[alloyType]`

## Requirements

- Level 15 Smithing

## Boosts

- 15% speed boost for Smiths' outfit (**MUST** be equipped in skilling)
- Higher average mould score for 80+ Smithing (meaning higher xp + reputation)

## Choosing An Alloy

Basically, the higher the alloy tier, the more xp you will get. There are 8 different variations to choose from. If you choose a single alloy, it will use 28 bars per quantity. If you use a combination alloy, it will use 14 of each bar per quantity.

|                    |                    |                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| **Alloy Type**     | **Level Required** | **Metal Score** |
| Bronze             | 15                 | 10              |
| Iron               | 15                 | 20              |
| Steel              | 30                 | 30              |
| Iron/Steel         | 30                 | 40              |
| Steel/Mithril      | 50                 | 65              |
| Mithril/Adamantite | 70                 | 95              |
| Mithril/Runite     | 85                 | 110             |
| Adamantite/Runite  | 85                 | 130             |

## Metal Score

The metal score of each alloy will determine the amount of xp, gp and reputation received per trip. The higher the metal score, the more reputation and xp given, and therefore the more gp received (since gp is based on xp received).

## Unique Weapons

If you run the following command, you will see your overall foundry stats.

- `/minigames giants_foundry stats`

Here you will see your total unique weapons made. There are 1,331 possible weapons to create, with each weapon having an equal chance to be created. The type of alloy does not affect the chances of which weapon will be made. This means that using lower tier bars is considerably more cost effective if you're wanting to collect all unique weapons. There is no CL for these weapons, it's purely just a statistic.

## XP/Hour

With the full outfit and 80+ smithing, when using addy+rune alloys, you can expect to see between 240-270k xp/h.

With the full outfit and 80+ smithing, when using mith+addy alloys, you can expect to see between 190-210k xp/h.

## Rewards

While your minion will receive relatively decent xp, you will also gain coins and Foundry reputation. The amount of coins received is equal to `xp gained * 2`. The Foundry reputation given is equal to all your weapon scores combined in your trip. Reputation can be used to buy items from the shop.
