Look no further for amazing smithing XP and a use for those stacked-up bars! You don't need to buy moulds or make specific swords for Kovac—just choose a metal and send your minion on their way.

To start a trip of Giant's Foundry, use: [[/minigames giants_foundry start name\:[alloyType]]]

## Requirements

- [[smithing:15]]

## Boosts

- 15% speed boost for Smiths' outfit (**MUST** be equipped in skilling)
- Higher average mould score for [[smithing:80+]] (meaning higher XP + reputation)

## Choosing An Alloy

Basically, the higher the alloy tier, the more XP you will get. There are 8 different variations to choose from. If you choose a single alloy, it will use 28 bars per quantity. If you use a combination alloy, it will use 14 of each bar per quantity.

| **Alloy Type**     | **Level Required** | **Metal Score** |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Bronze             | 15                 | 10              |
| Iron               | 15                 | 20              |
| Steel              | 30                 | 30              |
| Iron/Steel         | 30                 | 40              |
| Steel/Mithril      | 50                 | 65              |
| Mithril/Adamantite | 70                 | 95              |
| Mithril/Runite     | 85                 | 110             |
| Adamantite/Runite  | 85                 | 130             |

## Metal Score

The metal score of each alloy determines the amount of XP, GP, and reputation received per trip. The higher the metal score, the more reputation and XP given—and therefore the more GP received (since GP is based on XP received).

## Unique Weapons

To view your overall foundry stats, use: [[/minigames giants_foundry stats]]

Here you will see your total unique weapons made. There are 1,331 possible weapons to create, with each having an equal chance to be created. The type of alloy does not affect which weapon is made. This means that using lower-tier bars is considerably more cost-effective if you're collecting all unique weapons. There is no CL for these weapons—it's purely a statistic.

## XP/Hour

With the full outfit and [[smithing:80+]], using addy+rune alloys yields 240–270k XP/h.

With the full outfit and [[smithing:80+]], using mith+addy alloys yields 190–210k XP/h.

## Rewards

While your minion receives decent XP, you'll also gain coins and Foundry reputation. Coins received = XP gained × 2. Foundry reputation is equal to all your weapon scores combined during your trip. Reputation can be used to buy items from the shop.
