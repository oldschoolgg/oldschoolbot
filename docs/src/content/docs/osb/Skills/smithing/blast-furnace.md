title: "Blast Furnace"
---

The Blast Furnace can be used with the **`blast_furnace:`**`true` option in the `/smelt` command. For example `/smelt`` `**`name:`**`Gold bar`` `**`blast furnace:`**`true`

The Blast Furnace costs 216,000 gp/hr to use, or 72,000 gp/hr if your minion is an ironman.

Smelting bars at the blast furnace is faster than smelting bars normally, and the amount of coal needed to smelt bars is halved.
