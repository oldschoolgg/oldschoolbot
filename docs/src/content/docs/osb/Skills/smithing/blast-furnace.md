The Blast Furnace can be used with the `blast_furnace:true` option in the [[/smelt name\:Gold bar blast_furnace\:true]] command.

The Blast Furnace costs 216,000 GP/h to use, or 72,000 GP/h if your minion is an ironman.

Smelting bars at the Blast Furnace is faster than smelting bars normally, and the amount of coal needed to smelt bars is halved.
