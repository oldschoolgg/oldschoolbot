title: "Wildy Slayer"
---

To start Wildy Slayer and set Krystilia as your Slayer master, use:

[[/slayer new_task master\:Krystilia save\:True]]

Krystilia assigns Wilderness-specific tasks. These tasks can only be completed in the Wilderness and run on a separate streak from normal Slayer tasks (i.e., you can reset your Wildy Slayer task streak without affecting your normal one).

## Wilderness & Death Chance

Since you will be in the Wilderness, there is always a chance to encounter PKers and lose gear. All information regarding PK encounters and death chance can be found on the [Wilderness page](../../bosses/wilderness/#pk-and-death-chance). These tasks use the same mechanics and PK supplies listed there.

All tasks are completed **unskulled**, **except for Revenants**, which must be done **skulled**. There is no way to avoid this.

## Larran's Chest

There are 3 highly sought-after items from this chest — the Dagon'hai robes. Each piece has a 1/256 chance and can be obtained in any order, including duplicates.

The chest also rewards high-level seeds, coal/iron/gold ores, rune armour, dragon arrow/dart tips, and other valuable drops. For full loot info, check the [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Larran's_big_chest).

## Ring of Wealth(i)

You can create and equip a Ring of wealth(i) to gain a 50% boost to clue scroll drop rates. This applies to any Wilderness content, **as long as the ring is equipped in your wildy setup**.

To create it:

1. **Craft the Dragonstone ring**  
   [[/craft name\:Dragonstone ring quantity\:1]]

2. **Enchant the ring**  
   [[/activities enchant name\:Dragonstone ring quantity\:1]]

3. **Imbue the Ring of wealth**  
   [[/create item\:Ring of wealth (i) quantity\:1]]

Only uncharged rings can be imbued. You will also need a **Ring of wealth scroll**, which can be obtained through Wildy Slayer or purchased from other players.
