title: "Wildy Slayer"
---

To start wildy slayer and set Krystilia as your slayer master, use:

[[/slayer new_task master\:Krystilia save\:True]]

You can select Krystilia for your slayer task for wildy specific tasks. These tasks can only be completed in the wildy, and they run on a seperate streak to your normal slayer tasks (i.e. you can reset your wildy slayer task streak without resetting your normal one).

## Wilderness & Death Chance

Since you will be in wildy, there is always the chance to encounter pkers and lose some gear. All information regarding pker encounters and death chance can be read on the [Wilderness page](../../bosses/wilderness/#pk-and-death-chance), as it uses the same mechanics and PK supplies listed there. Be aware that all tasks are completed unskulled, except for revenents. You can only do revenents skulled. There is no way to remove this.
