### FAQ

**Q: How do I use an unsired / Chewed bones?**  
A: Use [[/offering]]. [[/offer name\:Unsired]] and [[/offer name\:Chewed bones]]

**Q: What unlocks should I prioritise?**  
A: Superiors, blocks, task extensions. Slayer helm offers no advantages over a black mask.

**Q: How do I unlock/create a slayer helm?**  
A: [[/slayer rewards unlock unlockable\:Malevolent Masquerade]], then [[/create item\:Slayer helmet]] or [[/create item\:Slayer helmet (i)]]. This isn't needed as a black mask can be used for the same boost.

**Q: Does the superior rate increase with the Elite combat achievements?**  
A: Yes, they will automatically appear 25% more frequently after you claim the diary rewards.

**Q: Which slayer master should I use?**  
A: Depends on your goal; Konar for CL/XP or Duradel for bossing. Konar is better XP due to being able to complete tasks in any of Konar's assignable locations rather than a specific location (unlike OSRS).

**Q: How do I imbue my slayer helm/black mask?**  
A: [[/minigames soul_wars imbue name\:Black mask]] — you can get points through the [Soul Wars minigame](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/soul-wars) or through [Nightmare Zone](../../miscellaneous/nightmare-zone.md).

**Q: Do I need to equip my black mask/slayer helm to get the boost?**  
A: No, the boost works from the bank.

**Q: How do I get an arclight?**  
A: [[/buy name\:Darklight]], then [[/create item\:Arclight]] — requires 3 ancient shards.

**Q: How do I get a cannon?**  
A: [[/buy name\:Dwarf multicannon]]

**Q: Why am I using so many cannonballs?**  
A: Cannonballs are used at 16 per minute in single combat areas and 50 per minute in multi areas. This is intentional. XP works out similarly to in game.

**Q: How do I get an elemental/mind shield for wyverns?**  
A: [[/buy name\:Mind shield]]

**Q: How can I obtain the Ancient ceremonial robes?**  
A: [[/k name\:Blood Reaver]] (requires a Frozen key)

## Best gear for slayer

Individual gear bonuses (e.g. ranged attack, slash defence, etc.) cap at 95% of their maximum in-game value. These values can be found on the [OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Armour/Highest_bonuses). Due to attack values generally having easier to reach max values, it is best to prioritize reaching this 95% threshold, then focus on maximizing defence.

### Melee

Currently, only your **slash attack** is taken into account. The 95% threshold for slash attack is 172.9.  
If you do Jad tasks, it is best to equip a Saradomin Godsword. Otherwise, any godsword can be used, as they all have the same stats.

### Range

The 95% threshold for ranged attack is 233.7.

### Mage

The 95% threshold for magic attack is 168.15.  
It is also recommended to equip a staff that provides water runes in your misc setup (if you don't have a Kodai wand).

You can also create a gear preset for these setups after equipping them:  
[[/gear presets create name\:meleeslay copy_setup\:melee]]  
[[/gear presets create name\:rangeslay copy_setup\:range]]  
[[/gear presets create name\:mageslay copy_setup\:mage]]

Equip the presets with:  
[[/gear equip gear_setup\:Melee preset\:meleeslay]]  
[[/gear equip gear_setup\:Range preset\:rangeslay]]  
[[/gear equip gear_setup\:Mage preset\:mageslay]]

## Konar specific

Konar assigns tasks to specific locations. You can use any location that Konar can assign in-game. For example, Konar assigns black demons in both the Catacombs and Taverley Dungeon, allowing you to use a cannon or not use a cannon to receive ancient shards/totem pieces. However, Konar does not assign the area for demonic gorillas, so these won't count towards a black demon task.

_In simpler terms..._  
Konar assigns tasks to specific locations, slightly different to in-game. Therefore you may not be able to kill your relevant task’s boss counterparts or use a cannon/barrage.
