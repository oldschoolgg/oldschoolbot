title: "Slayer Boosts"
---

You will not receive totem pieces or ancient shards if you are using a cannon as cannons cannot be placed in the catacombs.

You can check the boosts for a specific monster and by how much by using the `/kshow_info:True` command.\
The Elysian spirit shield will also reduce your food usage by 17.5%, this needs to be equipped to work. Having a full Justiciar set equipped in your melee will further increase your food reduction by 6.5% on any Melee tasks

### General boosts

You can find boosts for bosses under the [boss boosts page.](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/boosts-and-requirements)

Certain foods give boosts to the trip time during PvM. See more information [here](../../getting-started/combat-skills.md#food-boosts).

Cannon boosts a number of bosses by a variable amount, the same applies for bursting and barraging.
