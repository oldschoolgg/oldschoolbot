To start training herblore, you need 10 qp to get the starting xp from the Druidic Ritual quest which will take you to level [[herblore:3]]. If you did not have 10 qp when herblore was released, you will have a 50% chance of getting the starting xp when questing post 10 qp.

You can buy vials of water using [[/buy name\:Vial of water quantity\:]]

For a list of potions, herbs, requirements, etc, check out the [OSRS Wiki Herblore Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Herblore)

## Making Potions

Making unfinished potions, cleaning herbs, and preparing secondary ingredients are all done with the [[/mix]] command. You can optionally use Zahur & Wesley to make these processes instant for a small fee.

- [[/mix name\:Crushed nest]]
- [[/mix name\:Toadflax]]
- [[/mix name\:Toadflax potion (unf)]]
- [[/mix name\:Saradomin brew (3)]]

**Zahur** - You can add the `zahur:True` flag to make unfinished potions or clean herbs instantly. This costs 200gp per item. Zahur will not clean herbs that you do not have the required herblore level to clean yourself. No xp is given for cleaning herbs with Zahur.

- E.g. [[/mix name\:Toadflax zahur\:True]]

**Wesley** - You can add the `wesley:True` flag to crush your items instantly. This costs 50gp per item. There are no other requirements. Crushed items include: Crushed nest, Lava scale shard, Unicorn horn dust, Goat horn dust, Dragon scale dust, and Crushed superior dragon bones.

- E.g. [[/mix name\:Crushed nest wesley\:True]]
