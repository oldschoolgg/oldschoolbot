You can train Crafting with the [[/craft]] command. For example, [[/craft name\:Leather gloves quantity\:100]]. To start training Crafting, you will probably want to first kill cows for cowhide, then turn the cowhide into leather using [[/craft name:Leather]], then craft leather gloves from those. Alternatively, you can also buy these items from our grand-exchange channel.

To see all the items you can craft, check the [Crafting Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crafting) - most of the items are in the bot, with the exact same level and item requirements.
