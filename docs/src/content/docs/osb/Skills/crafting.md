# Crafting

You can train Crafting with the `+tan` and `+craft` command. For example, `+craft 100 leather gloves`. To start training Crafting, you will probably want to first kill cows for cowhide, then turn the cowhide into leather using `+tan leather`, then craft leather gloves from those. Alternatively, you can also buy these items from our grand-exchange channel.

To see all the items you can craft, type `+craft --items` check the [Crafting Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crafting) - most of the items are in the bot, with the exact same level and item requirements.

#### Boosts

You can tan items 3.5 times faster once you have the skill requirements for the [Falador Hard Diary](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Falador_Diary#Hard) or have 99 crafting.
