## Hespori

While Hespori does fall under the boss category, there are no boosts for killing it. The only requirement is 65 Farming to access the medium tier of the Farming guild.

It takes approximately 32 hours to grow.

It does drop all 3 Anima seeds but they currently have no use. Additionally, it does drop the Bottomless compost bucket at 1/35 chance, but this has no functional use either.
