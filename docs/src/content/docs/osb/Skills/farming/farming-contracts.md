An easy way to get additional seeds while farming is to take on a [farming contract](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Guildmaster_Jane#Farming_contracts) from Farming Guildmaster Jane using the [[/farming contract]] command. Seed packs are tiered from 1-5 and work the exact same as the main game.

If you are tier 1 patron or higher (and your plant is fully grown), you will see an **'Auto Farming Contract'** button at the end of your trips. This can be enabled/disabled using: [[/config user toggle name\:Disable Auto Farm Contract Button]]

## Requirements

- [[farming\:45]] (Easy contracts)
- [[farming\:65]] (Medium contracts)
- [[farming\:85]] (Hard contracts)

## Commands

To get a contract: [[/farming contract input\:]]

To make an existing contract easier: [[/farming contract input\:easier]]

To open your seed pack: [[/open name\:seed pack]]

## Contract Rewards

Each contract is tiered from 1-5, depending on the seed you were asked to plant. Generally, the harder the contract, the higher the tier. The tier will determine the reward from your seed pack. For more info on what tier your contract is and your potential reward, visit the respective OSRS pages:
