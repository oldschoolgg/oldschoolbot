title: "Auto Farming"
---

Auto farming collects ready patches into a single Farming activity so you can harvest and replant everything without running multiple commands.

## Overview

- [[/farming auto_farm]] checks every patch you have unlocked, harvests anything ready, and replants according to your filter.
- The trip is planned as one continuous Farming activity whose duration equals the sum of each patch step (travel, harvest, replant). Your minion stays out for the full Farming trip length instead of returning after every patch.
- You can also trigger auto farming from the button that appears on [[/farming check_patches]] when something is ready.

## Filters

- **AllFarm** (default) - Plants the best seed you can use in each ready patch, prioritising higher-level crops.
- **Replant** - Only replants patches that already contained that crop and that you still have seeds for. Empty patches stay empty.
- Configure the behaviour with [[/farming auto_farm_filter auto_farm_filter_data:AllFarm]] or [[/farming auto_farm_filter auto_farm_filter_data:Replant]].

## Trip Planning

- Auto farming respects your maximum Farming trip length (see [[/minion activities]]). Steps that would exceed the limit are skipped and reported in the chat response.
- Each step is timestamped, so the harvesting order in the summary matches the real execution order.
- If your minion is already busy the command will refuse to start.

## Resource Handling

- Seeds, compost, farmer payments, and tree removal fees are checked up-front. If you cannot afford a requirement the affected patch is skipped, and the first failure reason is shown.
- Your [[/farming default_compost]] choice and [[/farming always_pay]] toggle are applied automatically.
- Coins for chopping trees without the required Woodcutting level are reserved (200 gp for most trees, 2,000 gp for redwoods).
- All item costs are removed immediately; the activity will not start unless every chosen step can be paid for.

## Boosts

- Equip full graceful and a charged [Ring of endurance](../agility/hallowed-sepulchre.md#ring-of-endurance) to stack the 10% + 10% trip speed bonuses.
- Completing the Ardougne elite diary grants an additional 4% time reduction on auto farm trips.
- Farming outfit, magic secateurs, and the Farming cape apply the same XP and yield bonuses as manual planting.

## Tips

- Keep your seed, compost, and protection stocks topped up so auto farming can plan the maximum number of patches per trip.
- Use `Replant` when you want to maintain a static herb run and `AllFarm` when you prefer "always best available" crops.
- If you have more ready patches than the trip length allows, queue a second auto farm trip once the first finishes.
- Review [Patch Unlocks](README.md#patch-unlocks) to make sure you have unlocked every patch that auto farming can use.
