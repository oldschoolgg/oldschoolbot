title: "Farming"
---

Farming in the bot works like in-game: your minion is sent on planting or harvesting trips, and crops grow in the background. Patch access scales with your quest points, Farming level, and major quest unlocks such as *Children of the Sun*.

When harvesting trees, either:

- Meet the Woodcutting level (and receive logs), or
- Pay 200gp for a farmer to remove the tree (no logs)

Other farming activities:

- [Farming Contracts](farming-contracts.md)
- [Tithe Farm](tithe-farm.md)
- [Hespori](farmables.md#hespori)

## Commands

- [[/farming plant]] - Plant or harvest and replant
- [[/farming harvest]] - Harvest without replanting
- [[/farming check_patches]] - View patch status (includes an Auto Farm shortcut button when anything is ready)
- [[/farming auto_farm]] - Execute an auto farming trip
- [[/farming auto_farm_filter]] - Choose your auto farm filter
- [[/farming default_compost]] - Set the compost tier to auto apply
- [[/farming always_pay]] - Toggle automatic farmer payments

## Auto Farming

Use [[/farming auto_farm]] to harvest and replant every ready patch your current filter allows in a single trip. The command now:

- Builds a combined plan that spends the entire Farming trip length, chaining each patch back-to-back.
- Respects [[/farming auto_farm_filter]] choices (`AllFarm` to use your best seeds everywhere, `Replant` to stick to what was already growing).
- Applies your [[/farming default_compost]] choice and [[/farming always_pay]] setting automatically.
- Skips patches that would push the trip beyond the max duration or when you lack the required seeds, compost, or protection items.

See [Auto Farming](auto-farming.md) for a full breakdown, including resource handling and troubleshooting tips.

## Compost

- **Compost** - Buy for 400gp: [[/buy name:Compost]]
- **Supercompost** - Made via [[/farming compost_bin]] or dropped/bought
