title: "Farming"
---

Farming in the bot works like in-game: your minion is sent on planting/harvesting trips, and crops grow in the background. The number of available patches increases with your quest points and farming level.

When harvesting trees, either:

- Meet the woodcutting level (and receive logs), or
- Pay 200gp for a farmer to remove the tree (no logs)

Other farming activities:

- [Farming Contracts](farming-contracts.md)
- [Tithe Farm](tithe-farm.md)
- [Hespori](farmables.md#hespori)
