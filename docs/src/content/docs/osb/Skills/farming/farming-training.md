# Farming Training

**Before you start:** Decide what tier of compost you want to use. Ultracompost is definitely worth obtaining if you plan on doing any serious farming.\
Use `/farming default_compost`` `**`compost:`**`Ultracompost` before you start doing any farming and make sure to keep up on supply. At a bare minimum use supercompost, as it's very easy to get from wildy bosses or the `/farming compost_bin` command.

Ultra compost can be obtained by mining volcanic ash and combining with super compost.\
`/mine`` `**`name:`**`Volcanic ash`\
`/create`` `**`item:`**`Ultracompost`

## Optimal route to level 99

`/farming check_patches`

`/farming default_compost`` `**`compost:`**`Ultracompost`

`/farming always_pay`

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Potato` (until level 5)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Onion` (until level 7)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Cabbage` (until level 12)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Tomato` (until level 15)

**Now farm tree seeds, Hardwood seeds, fruit tree seeds and Special seeds until 99**

**Tree seeds**

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Oak tree` (until level 30)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Willow tree` (until level 45)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Maple tree` (until level 60)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Yew tree` (until level 75)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Magic tree` (Repeat to 99)

**Hardwood seeds**

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Teak tree` (Level 35-55)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Mahogany tree` (Repeat to 99)

**Fruit tree seeds**

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Pineapple tree` (Level 51-57)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Papaya tree` (until level 68)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Palm tree` (until level 81)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Dragonfruit tree` (Repeat to 99)

**Special seeds**

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Calquat tree` (Level 72-99)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Spirit tree` (Level 83-99)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Celastrus tree` (Level 85-99)

`/farming plant`` `**`plant_name:`**`Redwood tree` (Level 90-99)
