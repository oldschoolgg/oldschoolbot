**Before you start:** Decide what tier of compost you want to use. Ultracompost is highly recommended for serious farming.

Set your default compost using:  
[[/farming default_compost compost\:Ultracompost]]  
Make sure to maintain your compost supply. At minimum, use supercompost (easy to get from wildy bosses or [[/farming compost_bin]]).

Ultracompost is created by mining volcanic ash and combining it with supercompost:  
[[/mine name\:Volcanic ash]]  
[[/create item\:Ultracompost]]

## Optimal Route to Level 99

[[/farming check_patches]]  
[[/farming default_compost compost\:Ultracompost]]  
[[/farming always_pay]]

[[/farming plant plant_name\:Potato]] (until [[farming:5]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Onion]] (until [[farming:7]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Cabbage]] (until [[farming:12]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Tomato]] (until [[farming:15]])

**Now farm Tree, Hardwood, Fruit Tree, and Special seeds until 99**

### Tree Seeds

[[/farming plant plant_name\:Oak tree]] (until [[farming:30]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Willow tree]] (until [[farming:45]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Maple tree]] (until [[farming:60]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Yew tree]] (until [[farming:75]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Magic tree]] (repeat until 99)

### Hardwood Seeds

[[/farming plant plant_name\:Teak tree]] ([[farming:35]]–[[farming:55]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Mahogany tree]] (repeat until 99)

### Fruit Tree Seeds

[[/farming plant plant_name\:Pineapple tree]] ([[farming:51]]–[[farming:57]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Papaya tree]] (until [[farming:68]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Palm tree]] (until [[farming:81]])  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Dragonfruit tree]] (repeat until 99)

### Special Seeds

[[/farming plant plant_name\:Calquat tree]] ([[farming:72]]–99)  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Spirit tree]] ([[farming:83]]–99)  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Celastrus tree]] ([[farming:85]]–99)  
[[/farming plant plant_name\:Redwood tree]] ([[farming:90]]–99)
