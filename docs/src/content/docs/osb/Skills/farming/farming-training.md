**Before you start:** Decide what tier of compost you want to use. Ultracompost is definitely worth obtaining if you plan on doing any serious farming.\
Use `/farming default_compost compost\:Ultracompost` before you start doing any farming and make sure to keep up on supply. At a bare minimum use supercompost, as it's very easy to get from wildy bosses or the `/farming compost_bin` command.

Ultra compost can be obtained by mining volcanic ash and combining with super compost.\
`/mine name\:Volcanic ash`\
`/create item\:Ultracompost`

## Optimal route to level 99

`/farming check_patches`

`/farming default_compost compost\:Ultracompost`

`/farming always_pay`

`/farming plant plant_name:Potato` (until level 5)

`/farming plant plant_name:Onion` (until level 7)

`/farming plant plant_name:Cabbage` (until level 12)

`/farming plant plant_name:Tomato` (until level 15)

**Now farm tree seeds, Hardwood seeds, fruit tree seeds and Special seeds until 99**

**Tree seeds**

`/farming plantplant_name:Oak tree` (until level 30)

`/farming plantplant_name:Willow tree` (until level 45)

`/farming plantplant_name:Maple tree` (until level 60)

`/farming plantplant_name:Yew tree` (until level 75)

`/farming plantplant_name:Magic tree` (Repeat to 99)

**Hardwood seeds**

`/farming plantplant_name:Teak tree` (Level 35-55)

`/farming plantplant_name:Mahogany tree` (Repeat to 99)

**Fruit tree seeds**

`/farming plantplant_name:Pineapple tree` (Level 51-57)

`/farming plantplant_name:Papaya tree` (until level 68)

`/farming plantplant_name:Palm tree` (until level 81)

`/farming plantplant_name:Dragonfruit tree` (Repeat to 99)

**Special seeds**

`/farming plantplant_name:Calquat tree` (Level 72-99)

`/farming plantplant_name:Spirit tree` (Level 83-99)

`/farming plantplant_name:Celastrus tree` (Level 85-99)

`/farming plantplant_name:Redwood tree` (Level 90-99)
