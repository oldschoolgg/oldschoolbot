title: "Fishing"
---

You can train Fishing using [[/fish name\:Shrimps/Anchovies quantity\:5]], [[/fish name\:Lobster quantity\:100]]

Fishing bait is buyable with: [[/buy name\:Fishing bait]]

Dark fishing bait and Raw Karambwanji are **not** sold by the bot. You must obtain them yourself or buy from other players.

## Fishing System Updates

The fishing pipeline now uses a **tick-based simulation** (0.6s ticks) with per-catch rolls. Multi-fish spots track each subfish separately, and those catch arrays are persisted so trips resolve correctly after the rework.
Runtime fish data is sourced from `Fishing.Fishes` in code; `fishing-fishables.json` is generated snapshot data for docs/export tooling.

- Per-catch extra fish rolls: Rada’s blessing and Spirit flakes add extra fish without additional XP or extra clue/pet rolls.
- Powerfishing uses faster tick rates (where supported) and disables Spirit flakes.
- Barbarian cut-eat is supported when **Barbarian fishing** is powerfished at **99 Fishing** and **80 Cooking**, granting Cooking XP while reducing bait usage.
- Moon key halves can be rolled **per catch** after *Children of the Sun* on eligible fish (see Boosts).

## Boosts

### Angler Outfit

Obtainable from [Fishing Trawler](fishing-trawler) and [Aerial Fishing](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/fishing/aerial-fishing). When equipped in the skilling setup, it gives:

- 0.4% — Angler hat
- 0.8% — Angler top
- 0.6% — Angler waders
- 0.2% — Angler boots
- 2.5% — Full outfit equipped in skilling setup

### Spirit Flakes

- 50% chance to catch double fish per action when using Spirit flakes
- Extra fish gives no additional XP

### Rada’s Blessing

When equipped (and not powerfishing), Rada’s blessing grants a chance at extra fish per catch:

- 2% — Rada’s blessing 1
- 4% — Rada’s blessing 2
- 6% — Rada’s blessing 3
- 8% — Rada’s blessing 4

### Tools

Equipping the following tools in **any** setup reduces catch time:

- 5% — Pearl fishing rod (bait fishing)
- 5% — Pearl fly fishing rod (fly fishing)
- 5% — Pearl barbarian rod (barbarian fishing)
- 5% — Crystal harpoon (harpooning, caging, netting)

Harpoon boosts for **Tuna/Swordfish** and **Shark** spots:

- 35% — Crystal harpoon
- 20% — Dragon harpoon
- 20% — Infernal harpoon

### Storage

- **Fish barrel** or **Fish sack barrel** adds 28 inventory slots and extends trips by 9 minutes (non-minnow).

### Moon Key

After *Children of the Sun*, the following fish have per-catch rolls for moon key halves:

- **Trout/Salmon** — 1/4100
- **Tuna/Swordfish** — 3/5000
- **Lobster** — 3/5000
- **Shark** — 1/580

## Training

### Fastest Route to 99

- [[/fish name\:Shrimps/Anchovies]] from [[fishing:1]]–[[fishing:5]]
- [[/fish name\:Sardine/Herring]] from [[fishing:5]]–[[fishing:20]] (requires fishing bait)
- **OPTIONAL:** Fishing Trawler for Angler outfit
- [[/fish name\:Trout/Salmon]] from [[fishing:20]]–[[fishing:58]] (requires feathers)
- **OPTIONAL:** Aerial Fishing (requires minimum [[hunter:35]]) for Pearl barbarian rod
- [[/fish name\:Barbarian fishing]] from [[fishing:58]]–[[fishing:71]] (requires feathers)
- [[/k name\:tempoross]] from [[fishing:71]]–[[fishing:99]] using a crystal harpoon

[Tempoross](/osb/activities/tempoross/) is a faster option than Barbarian Fishing once you have a crystal tool seed (from Zalcano) and a Dragon harpoon (from Wyrms or Tempoross) to create a crystal harpoon. Requires [[fishing:35]]. Tempoross also provides large amounts of raw food for ironmen.

Alternatively, continuing Barbarian Fishing is the cheaper and next-best method to reach 99.

### Best Pet Chance

Currently, the fastest pet method is fishing Karambwans.

### Additional Information

[Aerial Fishing](/osb/activities/aerial-fishing/) at [[fishing:43]]/[[hunter:35]] is more efficient than training Hunting or Fishing separately if your goal is 99 in both.

### **Collection Log Slots Obtainable by Fishing**

- Bass (Big Bass)
- Swordfish (Big Swordfish)
- Shark (Big Shark)
- Angler outfit
- [Aerial Fishing](/osb/activities/aerial-fishing/): 3 Rods, Golden Tench, Fish Sack

## XP/hr

Assuming you use full Angler Outfit, Crystal harpoon, and a Pearl rod (when and where possible).
