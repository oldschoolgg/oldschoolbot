You can train Fishing using [[/fish name\:Shrimps quantity\:5]], [[/fish name\:Lobster quantity\:100]]

Fishing bait is buyable with: [[/buy name\:Fishing bait]]

Dark fishing bait and Raw Karambwanji are **not** sold by the bot. You must obtain them yourself or buy from other players.

## Boosts

### Angler Outfit

Obtainable from [Fishing Trawler](fishing-trawler.md) and [Aerial Fishing](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/fishing/aerial-fishing). When equipped in the skilling setup, it gives:

- 0.4% — Angler hat
- 0.8% — Angler top
- 0.6% — Angler waders
- 0.2% — Angler boots
- 2.5% — Full outfit equipped in skilling setup

### Spirit Flakes

- 50% chance to catch double fish per action when using Spirit flakes
- Extra fish gives no additional XP

### Tools

Equipping the following tools in **any** setup reduces catch time:

- 5% — Pearl fishing rod (bait fishing)
- 5% — Pearl fly fishing rod (fly fishing)
- 5% — Pearl barbarian rod (barbarian fishing)
- 5% — Crystal harpoon (harpooning, caging, netting)

### Fish

- [[/fish name\:Barbarian fishing]] — for Barbarian Fishing
- **Karambwanji** (bait for Karambwan) requires **15 QP**
- **Monkfish** requires **100 QP**
- **Anglerfish** requires **40 QP**
- **Minnows** require **full Angler outfit**
  - To trade minnows, use: [[/buy name\:raw shark]]

## Fishing Trawler

Base time per game: 13 minutes

- 1/8 chance per trip to receive a unique Angler piece you don’t already have
- 1/5000 chance per trip to receive the Heron pet

### Trawler Boosts

- +0.2% trip time reduction per KC (up to +10% at 50 KC)
- +50% fish received with [Elite Ardougne Diary](../../miscellaneous/achievement-diaries.md#ardougne-diary-elite)

## Training

### Fastest Route to 99

- [[/fish name\:Shrimps]] from [[fishing:1]]–[[fishing:5]]
- [[/fish name\:Sardine]] from [[fishing:5]]–[[fishing:10]] (requires fishing bait)
- [[/fish name\:Herring]] from [[fishing:10]]–[[fishing:20]] (requires fishing bait)
- **OPTIONAL:** Fishing Trawler for Angler outfit
- [[/fish name\:Trout]] from [[fishing:20]]–[[fishing:30]] (requires feathers)
- [[/fish name\:Salmon]] from [[fishing:30]]–[[fishing:58]] (requires feathers)
- **OPTIONAL:** Aerial Fishing (requires minimum [[hunter:35]]) for Pearl barbarian rod
- [[/fish name\:Barbarian fishing]] from [[fishing:58]]–[[fishing:71]] (requires feathers)

[[/k name\:tempoross]] from [[fishing:71]]–[[fishing:99]] using a crystal harpoon

[Tempoross](/osb/activities/tempoross/) is a faster option than Barbarian Fishing once you have a crystal tool seed (from Zalcano) and a Dragon harpoon (from Wyrms or Tempoross) to create a crystal harpoon. Requires [[fishing:35]]. Tempoross also provides large amounts of raw food for ironmen.

Alternatively, continuing Barbarian Fishing is the cheaper and next-best method to reach 99.

### Best Pet Chance

Currently, the fastest pet method is fishing Karambwans.

### Additional Information

[Aerial Fishing](/osb/activities/aerial-fishing/) at [[fishing:43]]/[[hunter:35]] is more efficient than training Hunting or Fishing separately if your goal is 99 in both.

### **Collection Log Slots Obtainable by Fishing**

- Bass (Big Bass)
- Swordfish (Big Swordfish)
- Shark (Big Shark)
- Angler outfit
- [Aerial Fishing](/osb/activities/aerial-fishing/): 3 Rods, Golden Tench, Fish Sack

## XP/hr

Assuming you use full Angler Outfit, Crystal harpoon, and a Pearl rod (when and where possible).
