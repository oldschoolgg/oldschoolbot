You can train Firemaking using [[/light name\:]], for example [[/light name\:Willow logs]]. To see all the logs you can burn, xp rates, etc, check out the [OSRS Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Firemaking).

Firemaking can also be trained via the [Wintertodt](osb/activities/wintertodt) minigame.

## Fastest Route to 99

1. [[/light name\:Logs quantity\:61]]
1. [[/light name\:Oak logs quantity\:183]]
1. [[/light name\:Willow logs quantity\:101]]
1. [[/light name\:Teak logs quantity\:751]]
1. [[/k name\:Wintertodt]] to 99 (will require 4 pieces of warm clothing and some food)

It's a good idea to get at least 30 Construction and Woodcutting before starting Wintertodt to maximize the xp you get in those skills as well.

## Boosts

- The pyromancer outfit, when equipped anywhere, gives a 2.5% boost to Firemaking xp (including at Wintertodt).

## Tips

Food is easily obtainable with 65 Attack+Strength using [[/buy name\:potato with cheese]] (650gp each).
Burning Magic or Redwood logs is faster xp than Wintertodt but are harder to come by.
High Woodcutting levels will provide a boost for Wintertodt so if you want both 99s it's recommended to get 95 Woodcutting before starting.
