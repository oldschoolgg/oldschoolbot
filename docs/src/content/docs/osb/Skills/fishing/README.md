# Fishing

You can train Fishing using `/fishname:<fish>quantity:<quantity>`, for example `/fishname:Lobsterquantity:100`

Fishing bait is buyable with `/buyname: ``Fishing bait`.

Dark fishing bait and Raw Karambwanji aren't sold by the bot and can only be obtained by buying from other players or obtaining them yourself.
