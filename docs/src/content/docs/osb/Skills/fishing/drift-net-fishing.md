# Drift Net Fishing

The drift net activity is an efficient method for training fishing and hunter simultaneously. You can expect to see around 100k hunter and 75k fishing xp/h at lower levels. This can increase up to 135k hunter and 100k fishing xp/h at higher levels. Please be mindful of decent up and down variations in xp/h (around 10-15k).
