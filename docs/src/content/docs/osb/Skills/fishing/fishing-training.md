## Fastest Route to 99

[[/fish name\:Shrimps]] from [[fishing:1]]–[[fishing:5]]  
[[/fish name\:Sardine]] from [[fishing:5]]–[[fishing:10]] (requires fishing bait)  
[[/fish name\:Herring]] from [[fishing:10]]–[[fishing:20]] (requires fishing bait)  
**OPTIONAL:** Fishing Trawler for Angler outfit  
[[/fish name\:Trout]] from [[fishing:20]]–[[fishing:30]] (requires feathers)  
[[/fish name\:Salmon]] from [[fishing:30]]–[[fishing:58]] (requires feathers)  
**OPTIONAL:** Aerial Fishing (requires minimum [[hunter:35]]) for Pearl barbarian rod  
[[/fish name\:Barbarian fishing]] from [[fishing:58]]–[[fishing:71]] (requires feathers)

[[/k name\:tempoross]] from [[fishing:71]]–[[fishing:99]] using a crystal harpoon

[Tempoross](tempoross.md) is a faster option than Barbarian Fishing once you have a crystal tool seed (from Zalcano) and a Dragon harpoon (from Wyrms or Tempoross) to create a crystal harpoon. Requires [[fishing:35]]. Tempoross also provides large amounts of raw food for ironmen.

Alternatively, continuing Barbarian Fishing is the cheaper and next-best method to reach 99.

### Best Pet Chance

Currently, the fastest pet method is fishing Karambwans.

### Additional Information

[Aerial Fishing](aerial-fishing.md) at [[fishing:43]]/[[hunter:35]] is more efficient than training Hunting or Fishing separately if your goal is 99 in both.
