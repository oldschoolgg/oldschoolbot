# Mining Training

## Fastest Route to 99

This is the fastest method to obtain 99 mining. It yields almost no profit since it's all done via powermining.

1-15: Powermine Copper/Tin\
15-45: Powermine Iron\
45-99: Powermine Granite

While you can obtain the prospector's outfit from Motherlode mine with golden nuggets (fastest method), the time spent to obtain the outfit is negligible against overall time to get to 99.

## Profitable Route to 99

1-15: Powermine Copper/Tin\
15-37: Powermine Iron\
37-50: Mine Volcanic ash\
50-71: Mine Iron (For use of Crystal pickaxe)\
**PICK N MIX UNTIL 99**\
Mine Gold ore (fastest and quite profitable)\
Mine Gem rocks (best pet chance but much less profitable)\
Mine Amethyst from 92-99 (with expert mining gloves)\
Zalcano (12-16k xp/hr)
