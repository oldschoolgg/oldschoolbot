title: "Forestry"
---

This minigame is conducted passively while completing _almost any_ woodcutting trip. Provided you have selected \*\*`forestry_events:True` in your woodcutting trip, your minion will automatically participate in all forestry events. For each event you minion does, you will obtain Anima-infused bark and various other items, as well as the usual bird nests.

**You cannot get Anima-infused bark from Normal logs, Sulliusceps, or Redwoods!**

## Requirements

- There are no requirements for this activity

## Boosts

- Regular woodcutting [axe boosts](./#axes)
- 20% boost to Bird nests from [Twitcher's gloves](forestry.md#twitchers-gloves)

## Forestry Events

There are 9 forestry events. Each one has an equal chance to spawn. The chance of a forestry event spawning is 1/20 for every minute of your trip (average of 1 event per 20 mins). Some events will give common items, bonus xp, or a unique CL item. All events will give between 250-500 Anima-infused bark.

## Twitcher's Gloves

Equipping these gloves in any setup will allow minions to receive a boost for a specific type of nest during woodcutting trips. Using one of the four flags when sending a woodcutting trip will provide a 20% extra chance to receive the nest specified in the flag. This stacks with the [Rabbit foot necklace](../hunter/#rabbit-foot-necklace). The 4 flags are:

- \*\*`twitchers_gloves:egg nest`
- \*\*`twitchers_gloves:ring nest`
- \*\*`twitchers_gloves:seed nest`
- \*\*`twitchers_gloves:clue nest`
