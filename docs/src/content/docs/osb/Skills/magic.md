title: "Magic (Non-combat)"
---

You can train your magic level through various non-combat spells in the bot. This includes casting lunar spells, teleport spells, and enchanting jewellery and bolts. All casting and enchanting spells require the same levels and runes as they do in OSRS.

**Note:** Equipping an [elemental staff](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Elemental_staves) in your _skilling setup_ will cut down on rune costs.

## Casting

There are numerous useful casting spells that can be used to train magic. All cast spells require 50 QP except for teleports and Bones to Bananas.

To use any of the following spells, use the [[/activities cast]] command.

- e.g. [[/activities cast spell\:Camelot Teleport quantity\:100]]

## Enchanting

## Regular Alching

You can send your minion on an alching trip using the [[/activities alch]] command. You may specify the item and quantity, or omit both to alch whatever is in your favourite alchs list. Note: this is separate from agility alching.

## Agility Alching

You can cast High Alchemy while running agility laps. This is useful for ironmen or players wanting to maximise time spent.
