# Rogues Den

Complete laps of the maze using `/minigames rogues_den start` for a chance to obtain pieces of the Rogues Outfit.

It works a bit differently to in game, after your trip returns you'll receive loot with an equal chance at any of the 5 outfit pieces.

### Requirements

- 50 Thieving
- 50 Agility

### Boosts

- 80 Thieving provides a 40% boost
- Stamina potions provide a 50% boost
  - These are automatically used if you have them in your bank (1 potion per 4 laps).

### Rewards

- Rogues outfit (mask, top, trousers, gloves, boots)
  - Each piece provides a 20% chance of double loot when pickpocketing (100% with full outfit).
  - Must be equipped in the Skilling setup

`/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**`Skilling`` `**`item:`**`Rogue top` - Equips a single piece

`/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**`Skilling`` `**`preset:`**`rogue` - Equips the entire set
