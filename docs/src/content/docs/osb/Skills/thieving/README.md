title: "Thieving"
---

You can train thieving using the [[/steal]] command. To start training Thieving, you can [[/steal name\:man]]. You will obtain the standard loot from each monster you can pickpocket, all of which can be found on the [OSRS Thieving Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Thieving). You can also choose to steal from stalls and chests, which are listed at the bottom of this page.

### Alternatives

You can also train thieving via Pyramid Plunder or obtain the Rogues outfit for double loot when pickpocketing any NPC.- See the [Pyramid Plunder](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/pyramid-plunder) page for details.- See the [Rogues Den](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/rogues-den) page for details.

## Boosts

**Pyramid Plunder** - 5% for Pharaoh's sceptre, remove 7.5% time penalty for full graceful. \
**Rogues Outfit** - Obtained through [Rogues' Den Minigame](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/rogues-den). When the full outfit is equipped in skilling, it provides a 100% chance to double all thieving loot.

## Thievable Stalls

You can also steal from stalls instead of pickpocketing. For most stalls, you will only receive a % of the potential loot in exchange for faster experience rates. **This cannot be changed.** In addition, xp rates for stealing at stalls is the same, regardless of thieving level.

XP/Hr is calculated using the chest respawn time and the average 97.5% success rate from chest steals; actual rates vary per trip.

### Rogues' Castle chest notes

- **Protection prayers:** Your minion must keep Protect from Melee active, which consumes 5–10 Prayer potion(4) or Blighted super restore(4) per hour (rounded up). If you have both, Blighted super restore(4) is used first.  
- **Wilderness diary loot scaling:** 25% less loot without the Wilderness medium diary, standard loot with medium, and 25% extra loot with the Wilderness hard diary.  
- **Ring of wealth (i):** Gives an extra hard clue roll (effectively doubling the hard clue chance).  
- **PK risk:** On completion, you can be PKed and lose 5–15% of your loot (hard clues are protected).
