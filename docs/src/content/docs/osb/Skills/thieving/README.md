title: "Thieving"
---

You can train thieving using the [[/steal]] command. To start training Thieving, you can [[/steal name\:man]]. You will obtain the standard loot from each monster you can pickpocket, all of which can be found on the [OSRS Thieving Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Thieving). You can also choose to steal from stalls, which are listed at the bottom of this page.

### Alternatives

You can also train thieving via Pyramid Plunder or obtain the Rogues outfit for double loot when pickpocketing any NPC.- See the [Pyramid Plunder](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/pyramid-plunder) page for details.- See the [Rogues Den](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/rogues-den) page for details.

## Boosts

**Pyramid Plunder** - 5% for Pharaoh's sceptre, remove 7.5% time penalty for full graceful. \
**Rogues Outfit** - Obtained through [Rogues' Den Minigame](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/rogues-den). When the full outfit is equipped in skilling, it provides a 100% chance to double all thieving loot.

## Thievable Stalls

You can also steal from stalls instead of pickpocketing. For most stalls, you will only receive a % of the potential loot in exchange for faster experience rates. **This cannot be changed.** In addition, xp rates for stealing at stalls is the same, regardless of thieving level.
