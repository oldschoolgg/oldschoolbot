You can train Fletching with the [[/fletch]] command. To see all the items you can fletch, check out the [Fletching Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fletching) - most of the items found there are fletchable in the bot, having the exact same level and item requirements.

### Fletching at the Hallowed Sepulchre

You can fletch certain "zero-time" items while completing laps of the Hallowed
Sepulchre. Start a run with the `fletching:` option and specify the item ID you
wish to fletch:

- `[[/minigames sepulchre start fletching\:Rune dart]]`

The following items can be fletched this way without increasing trip duration:
Broad arrows, Broad bolts, Amethyst broad bolts, all types of darts, arrows,
bolts, tipped bolts and javelins. The required items are removed from your bank
at the start of the trip and your minion will fletch as many as possible while
running the Sepulchre.
