# Crafting

You can train Crafting with the `/craft` command. For example, `/craft`` `**`name:`**`Leather gloves`` `**`quantity:`**`100`. To start training Crafting, you will probably want to first kill cows for cowhide, then turn the cowhide into leather using `/craft`` `**`name:`**`Leather`, then craft leather gloves from those. Alternatively, you can also buy these items from our grand-exchange channel.

To see all the items you can craft, check the [Crafting Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crafting) - most of the items are in the bot, with the exact same level and item requirements.

### Boosts

You can tan hides 3.5 times faster if you have completed the [Falador Hard Diary](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Falador_Diary#Hard) or have 99 crafting.
