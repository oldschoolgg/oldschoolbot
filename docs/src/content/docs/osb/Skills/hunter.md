# Hunter

From copper longtails to black chinchompas, use the hunter skill to track, trap, and catch a variety of critters. Though they're animals, they aren't stupid, and it will take some time to learn the most efficient ways to `+hunt` them, with a 10% maximum boost after 50 hours at a given creature. For a full list of creatures, you can use the `+hunt --creatures` command. Each creature also has a `+lb creatures` so you can see how you stack up against your fellow players. For example, to see the top black chinchompa hunters in OSB, you can `+lb creatures black chinchompa`. Make sure to have a set of graceful equipped in your skilling setup, as it provides boosts for certain creatures. Stamina potion \(4\)s will aid you in hunting the Herbiboar as well, and if you ever lack the level requirement for a creature, you can use the `--potion` flag to use hunter potion \(4\)s to boost if you have them.

A warning, black chin and black salamander hunting is dangerous! These wilderness creatures will put you in the path of virtual PKers, who may attack you, causing you to lose potions, catch chances, or even your minion's gear! A failed PK attempt will see you lose some saradomin brews and super restores, as well as lose some of your maximum catch chances. If the PKer kills you, you will lose some of the creatures you were catching, pots, as well as the body and leg slot items in your misc gear setup. While those two items are risked, their defensive stats also help you escape PKers, so it may be worth the risk.

Beyond the standard `+hunt` command, there are two additional forms of hunter: aerial fishing and birdhouses. Aerial fishing gives both fishing and hunter experience, as well as a rare chance at molch pears that you can use to purchase various skilling items. Rates improve with higher hunter and fishing levels as new `+aerialfish` targets are unlocked. Birdhouses are a passive way to earn hunter xp, and also provide bird nests which are useful for training herblore. Birdhouse runs need birdhouses, which can be crafted, and seeds to use as bait. To do a birdhouse run, use the `+birdhouse run` command followed by the type of birdhouse you want to use \(e.g. maple birdhouse\). To check the status of your birdhouses you can use the `+birdhouse check` command.
