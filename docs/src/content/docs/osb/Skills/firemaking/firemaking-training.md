# Firemaking Training

## Fastest Route to 99:

`/light`` `**`name:`**`Logs`` `**`quantity:`**`61`\
`/light`` `**`name:`**`Oak logs`` `**`quantity:`**`183`\
`/light`` `**`name:`**`Willow logs`` `**`quantity:`**`101`\
`/light`` `**`name:`**`Teak logs`` `**`quantity:`**`751`\
`/k`` `**`name:`**` ``Wintertodt` to 99 (will require 4 pieces of warm clothing and some food)\
It's a good idea to get at least 30 Construction and Woodcutting before starting Wintertodt to maximize the xp you get in those skills as well.

### Additional Information:

Food is easily obtainable with 65 Attack+Strength using `/buy`` `**`name:`**` ``potato with cheese` (650gp each).

Pyromancer outfit gives 2.5% xp boost and counts as warm clothes when equipped.

Burning Magic or Redwood logs is faster xp than Wintertodt but are harder to come by.

High Woodcutting levels will provide a boost for Wintertodt so if you want both 99s it's recommended to get \~95 Woodcutting before starting.
