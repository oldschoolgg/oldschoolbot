title: "Runecrafting"

You can train Runecrafting using [[/runecraft]].

Runecrafting can also be trained at the [Guardians of the Rift](/osb/activities/guardians-of-the-rift) minigame using `[/minigames gotr start]`.
When equipped in the skilling setup, the **Raiments of the eye** outfit grants up to **60%** extra runes during the minigame and while regular runecrafting.
An **Abyssal lantern** can be purchased with Abyssal pearls to further boost barrier repairs and mined fragments based on your Firemaking level.

## Boosts

There are several boosts available which apply to all runes except blood and soul runes. You can view the boosts for blood and soul runes on the [Dark Altar page](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/runecrafting/dark-altar). The true blood altar uses the same boosts as regular runecrafting.

- 5% for [[agility:60]] **OR** 10% for [[agility:90]]
- 10% for Graceful (equipped in any setup)
- 1% for [Ring of endurance](../agility/hallowed-sepulchre.md#ring-of-endurance) (works from bank but must be charged)
- 3% for Runecrafting cape
- 3% for Ring of the elements **(Combination runes only)**

## Pouches

You can create Runecrafting pouches using [[/create]]. Similarly to in-game, higher tier pouches also require higher Runecrafting levels to use. These boost the amount of essence you can carry in one inventory, increasing XP/hr.

| **Pouch**      | **Rc'ing Lvl Required To Use**        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Small Pouch    | [[runecraft:1]]                    |
| Medium Pouch   | [[runecraft:25]]                   |
| Large Pouch    | [[runecraft:50]]                   |
| Giant Pouch    | [[runecraft:75]]                   |
| Colossal Pouch | [[runecraft:85]] + [[crafting:56]] |

- Requires an Abyssal needle and one of each lower tier pouch to create.

## Regular Runes

| **Rune** | **Required Level**  |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Air      | [[runecraft:1]]  |
| Mind     | [[runecraft:2]]  |
| Water    | [[runecraft:5]]  |
| Earth    | [[runecraft:9]]  |
| Fire     | [[runecraft:14]] |
| Body     | [[runecraft:20]] |

| Death    | [[runecraft:65]] |
| Blood    | [[runecraft:77]] |
| Wrath    | [[runecraft:95]] |

- Blood runes crafted using the true blood altar also require the stats for Sins of the Father quest:
  - [[woodcutting:62]]
  - [[fletching:60]]
  - [[crafting:56]]
  - [[agility:52]]
  - [[attack:50]]

  - [[magic:49]]
  - [[herblore:40]]
  - [[strength:40]]
  - [[thieving:22]]
  - [[construction:5]]

## Multiple Runes

Just like in OSRS, certain levels will grant you multiple of regular runes. Combination runes are never multiplied.

## Combination Runes

**Note for Lava runes ONLY:** You can use the **[[/runecraft usestams\:false]]** option to send your minion runecrafting without using stamina potions. However, you will runecraft 3x slower than usual.

It's recommended to equip a staff in your skilling setup to provide infinite runes, for example a fire staff when crafting lava runes.

| **Rune** | **Required Level**  |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Mist     | [[runecraft:6]]  |
| Dust     | [[runecraft:10]] |
| Mud      | [[runecraft:13]] |
| Smoke    | [[runecraft:15]] |
| Steam    | [[runecraft:19]] |
| Lava     | [[runecraft:23]] |

## Tiaras

Crafting tiaras is a method of runecrafting training, albeit a very slow one. Tiaras don't have any use within the bot, except for being stored in [STASH units](../construction/stash-units.md). They can be created through the [[/runecraft]] command.

Tiaras don't have any level requirements for creating them. However, some tiaras including Cosmic, Death, Law & Wrath tiaras require 5, 10, 10 & 200 Quest Points respectively.

## Dark Altar

Blood runes and Soul runes can be crafted at the Dark Altar using [[/runecraft]]. This also gives some Mining and Crafting XP.

### Requirements

- [[mining:38]]
- [[crafting:38]]
- [[runecraft:77]] for Bloods
- [[runecraft:90]] for Souls
- [[agility:73]] highly recommended

### Boosts

- 10% additional runes for Kourend Elite diary.
- 20% faster essence mining for Kourend Medium diary.
- -20% penalty if you have no Graceful equipped.
- -35% penalty if you have less than [[agility:73]].
