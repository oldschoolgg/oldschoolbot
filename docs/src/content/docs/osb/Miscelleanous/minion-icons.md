title: "Minion Icons"
---

You can sacrifice items, and their GP value will go towards you unlocking new minion icons. You will automatically receive the icon immediately after sacrificing enough GP.

You can sacrifice items by using: [[/sacrifice]] (to specify quantity, put the number before the name).
- E.g. [[/sacrifice items\: bandos chestplate]]
- E.g. [[/sacrifice items\: 1000 gold ore]]
- E.g. [[/sacrifice items\: 100m coins]]

You receive a 15 second bonus to your maximum trip length for every 2.5b gp you sacrifice. This scales up to a 1 minute increase when you've sacrificed a total of 10b gp. This scaling is halved for ironmen, only requiring 5b gp to get the 1 minute increase.

You can see a leaderboard of who has sacrificed the most value using [[/lb sacrifice type\:Most Value Sacrificed]]

Tier 3 patrons or above receive 3 times the bonus to their trip length from sacrifice value. For example, a tier 3 patron with 2.5b sacrificed will receive a 45 second bonus and with 10b sacrificed will receive a 3 minute bonus.
