# Reverting Items

For starters, in most instances reverting items is something you may not necessarily be looking to do unless you are looking to sell something that has been made untradeable by adding an ornament to it or potentially charging it or even to break something down for components such as Zulrah items or even Bandos items into Bandosian components which is now needed as a result of [Nex](../bosses/nex.md) in order to create Torva items.

To start reverting items you are going to begin by doing `/create`` `**`item:`**` ``revert` and looking for the item that you are looking to revert into either:

- Components
- Original Item (removing an ornament or separating combined items)
- Recoloured/Transmoged Pets
- Reverting an item to Tickets (Castle Wars)

**Reverting items with charges on them will NOT delete the charges. Charges are bound to your minion and not the item itself.**

When reverting an item such as those listed below, you will be seeing a return of specific components in exchange for the item that is being reverted:

- Tanzanite fang or Toxic blowpipe (empty) (20,000 Zulrah scales)
- Magic fang (20,000 Zulrah scales)
- Serentine helm or Uncharged serpentine helm (20,000 Zulrah scales)
- Bandos chestplate (3 Bandosian components)
- Bandos tassets (2 Bandosian components)
- Armadyl helmet (1 Armadylean plate)
- Armadyl chestplate (4 Armadylean plates)
- Armadyl chainskirt (3 Armadylean plates)
- Ancient icon (5,000 Ancient essence)
- Venator shard (50,000 Ancient essence)
- Uncharged Wildy Weapons (7,500 Revenant ether)
- Xeric's talisman (inert) (100 Lizardman fangs)
- Slayer helmet (All components of the slayer helm)
- Themed slayer helmets (The recolour item and/or the slayer helm)

When reverting one of the items below you will be guaranteed to get your Ornament kit back in regards to ornament items. With the Nightmare staffs, you will receive back the Orb inserted in the staff and the Nightmare staff itself. Those items with ornaments are listed below:

- Zenyte Items (Tormented, Anguish, Torture)
- Godswords (Bandos, Armadyl, Zamorak, Saradomin)
- Scythe of vitur (Sanguine, Holy)
- Sanguinesti staff (Sanguine, Holy)
- Ghrazi papier (Sanguine, Holy)
- Dragon items (Defender, Pickaxe, Sq shield, Full helm, Platebody, Kiteshield, Boots, Scimitar, Platelegs, Plateskirt, Chainbody)
- Nightmare staffs (Eldritch, Volatile, Harmonised)
- Ferocious gloves (Hydra leather)
- Tzhaar-ket-om (t)

When reverting a castle wars item back into tickets, you will get full return of all tickets that were used. For more information on Castle Wars, how to get started, and the cost of all those items, make sure you make a trip to [Castle Wars](../minigames/castle-wars.md).

The only instance of reverting an item and not getting a component or an item return back is when doing `/create`` `**`item:`**` ``revert Dragon Pickaxe (upgraded)`, this will only return you the Dragon Pickaxe.
