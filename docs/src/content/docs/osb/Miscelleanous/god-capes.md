title: "God Capes"
---

You can collect both the regular and imbued god capes for a BiS mage cape slot. Some items are required and you do have the chance to fail (ma2 only). However, you will never lose your equipped items, just the supplies that are needed for each trip.

## Mage Arena 1

Upon completion of a single mage arena trip, you will receive all 3 regular god capes. You are able to repeat this trip as many times as you'd like.

To send your minion on a trip to collect the regular god capes use the following command:

- `/minigames mage_arena start`

### Requirements

- 60 Magic
- 100 Blood runes
- 500 Air runes
- 500 Fire runes
- 2 Prayer potion(4)

## Mage Arena 2

The second installment is not as easy as the first and can take multiple attempts to obtain the imbued god capes. You have up to a 70% chance to die, in which you will lose all your supplies for the current trip. Like the first however, you will be granted all 3 imbued capes upon completion.

To send your minion on a trip to collect the imbued god capes use the following command:

- `/minigames mage_arena_2 start`

### Requirements

- Completion of Mage Arena 1
- 75 Magic
- 300 Blood runes
- 500 Air runes
- 800 Fire runes
