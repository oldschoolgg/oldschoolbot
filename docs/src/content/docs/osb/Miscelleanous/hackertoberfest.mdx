title: Hacktoberfest 2024
---

As Hacktoberfest no longer gives t-shirts out, I'm running my own version of it. Hacktoberfest is a event where you get a reward for contributing to open source projects. It lasts for all of October. Anyone is able to participate. You don't necessarily need to be a developer to participate, you can also participate by editing the wiki.

> To discuss Hacktoberfest, or ask for help with how to contribute or edit the wiki, ask for help in the #developers channel in the discord.

## How to participate

1. Make 3 pull requests to one of the following code repositories, in October:
   - [Old School Bot](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot) (this has the main bot code for osb and bso, and all of the new wiki)
   - [OldschoolJS](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschooljs) (this has various osrs-related things like for simulating loot)

2. The pull requests need to be reasonably substantive, e.g. not just fixing a typo, changing a word,
changing formatting, changing 1 little thing, etc - they need to be real improvements or additions. The
pull requests also need to be accepted to count.

    Here are some random examples of PRs you can do that would be elligible:

    **Coding:**
        - Fixing Corporeal Beast to have more accurate kill-times and boosts (with some evidence showing its accurate)
        - Fixing a bug, like perhaps a button doesnt work.
        - Adding a new feature (note: it's recommended to discuss with us before adding a feature, unless its something in osrs)

    **Wiki:**
        - Updating a page for a particular skill, so it has accurate information and is formatted nicely, and up to date.
        - Updating training guides or the "Starter" guide to be accurate.
        - Fixing broken links, images, formatting, etc.

    *Read the [Wiki Page](/getting-started/wiki) for more information on how to edit the wiki. If you need help you can ask in Discord*

3. Once you've made 3 elligible pull requests that have been accepted/merged, let me know in the #developers channel in the discord so I can give you your rewards. NOTE: At the time of writing, the rewards are not yet claimable, so if you are early you may not get it immediately. You'll have the whole month too, so don't rush.

## Rewards

- A custom t-shirt: I'm still investigating how I can order/ship custom tshirts, but you'll get a custom t-shirt, and I will try to offer a few designs, e.g. with the OSB logo, with the BSO logo, with sandwich lady, with smokey, etc - and you'll be able to pick which one you want. I will also try to offer alternatives if you'd rather them over a t-shirt, e.g. a beanie, phone case, mug, hat, etc (all still with the same custom design). Please note to claim this prize, I will need your address to order/ship it to you.
- A Hacktoberfest badge for your minion

### Other rewards 
These rewards will be rolled after the month is over, and anyone who was elligible for a t-shirt, is elligible to win these. The same person can't win more than one of these rewards.

- One random participant will receive 20m OSRS GP
- One random participant will receive 5b OSB GP
- One random participant will receive 50b BSO GP
- One random participant will receive a Smokey (puffin) plushie (handmade by me, which I will ship to you, so you'll need to give your shipping address if you win):

## Other Rules/Information

1. You can only claim the rewards once per person.
2. You cannot transfer your prize to someone else, the person who made the PRs is the one who gets the reward.
3. If the person who wins the plushie doesn't want it, it will be rerolled - you can also let me know in advance if you don't want it, and I can exclude you from the draw.
4. A PR can be merged, but not accepted as elligible. For example, if you make a PR fixing a typo, I may merge it just to have that typo fixed, but it won't count towards your 3 PRs. 
5. If any wiki contributions are clearly A.I generated, they wont be elligible.
6. Any shady/weird stuff, like giving other people code and letting them submit it as their own, or submitting code that you didn't write, etc, will disqualify you from the event. You can always ask for help and give help.
