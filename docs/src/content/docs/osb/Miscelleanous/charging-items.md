# Charging Items

There are a number of degradable items that must be charged in order to be used or provide a boost for certain bosses/minigames. The maximum amount of charges on an item is 1,000,000. When charging an item, you can add anywhere between 1-100,000 at a time.

All items can be charged using `/minion charge`` `**`item:`** **`amount:`**

## Global Boosts

The weapons listed on this page will provide global boosts to all PvM, _provided they are equipped in their respective setup, are sufficiently charged, and you're training that specific combat style._ These global boosts stack with existing boosts (E.g. Shadow gives 20% boost at Kraken, and a further 6% if equipped in mage, charged, and your training is set to magic).

- [Abyssal tentacle](charging-items.md#abyssal-tentacle) - 3% global boost
- [Venator bow](charging-items.md#venator-bow) - 3% global boost
- [Trident of the swamp](charging-items.md#trident-of-the-swamp) - 3% global boost
- [Sanguinesti staff](charging-items.md#sanguinesti-staff) - 5% global boost
- [Scythe of vitur](charging-items.md#scythe-of-vitur) - 5% global boost
- [Tumeken's shadow](charging-items.md#tumekens-shadow) - 6% global boost

## Chargeable Items

Most items**cannot**be manually reverted, meaning you need to use the item continually until it runs out of charges to receive the base version again.

Charges are bound to your minion, not the item. Therefore, when reverting or trading your charged item, you will **NOT** lose charges.
