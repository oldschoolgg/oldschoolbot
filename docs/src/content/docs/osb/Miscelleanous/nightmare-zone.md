title: "Nightmare Zone"
---

One of the best places to grind out your melee 99s. With 3x the normal trip length, this is optimal activity to send before you go to bed! Nmz is intended to work as an afk activity, so it allows for more downtime between each trip.

## Requirements

- 43 Prayer
- 100 Quest points
- Full Dharok set (does not have to be equipped)
- Prayer potion(4) (**ONLY**if choosing the 'experience' strategy)
- GP to pay for dream costs
- Cost is halved if you have maximum QP

## Boosts

You will firstly receive a boost for your melee combat stats, including HP. If you have both 99 HP and 99 in your currently trained skill, your boost will be 65%.

You will also receive a boost for the highest tier item in each category. It does not have to be equipped.

  - Dragon claws (20%), Granite maul (15%), Dragon dagger(p++) (10%)
