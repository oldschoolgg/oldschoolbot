## Hybrid Monsters

To kill any of the hybrid monsters, use the `/k` command. Each monster requires both ingredients and when killed, will give a various number of one ingredient that was used. Each hybrid monster may drop a specific type of satchel and all have a 1/10 chance to drop the Tea flask.

E.g. `/k`` `**`name:`**`Unicow`
