title: "Creature Creation"
---

Combine various items to create and kill unique hybrid monsters to collect their drops. Each monster will drop a varying number of the same item that was used to create it. It works exactly the same as in OSRS.

## Requirements

- 35 Quest points

## Boosts

All of the following boosts work from the bank (i.e. they don't need to be equipped):

- 13% for Bandos platebody **or** Torva platebody
- 13% for Bandos tassets **or** Torva platebody
- 15% for Amulet of torture **or** 6% for Amulet of fury

## Hybrid Monsters

To kill any of the hybrid monsters, use the [[/k name\:Unicow]] command (replace `Unicow` with the desired monster name).  
Each monster requires both ingredients, and when killed, will return a varying number of one of the ingredients used.  
Each hybrid monster may drop a specific type of satchel, and all have a 1/10 chance to drop the Tea flask.
