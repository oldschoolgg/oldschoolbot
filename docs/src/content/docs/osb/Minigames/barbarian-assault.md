title: "Barbarian Assault"
---

Challenge waves of penance monsters to unlock the rewards from Barbarian Assault. BA in the bot works a bit differently than BA in OSRS, as it is only soloable and the rest of your team members are essentially NPCs. There are no defined roles or role-specific honour levels, there aren't even specific waves. However, you do have a 25% chance to be selected as the fighter role, and when this happens, you will get a speed boost based on your melee gear ([see below](barbarian-assault.md#bis-melee-gear)).

To start a trip of BA, use the following command:

- [[/minigames barb_assault start]]

## Boosts

- Up to 13.11% for melee gear ([see below](barbarian-assault.md#bis-melee-gear))
- Up to 30.3% for honour level ([see below](barbarian-assault.md#honour-level))
- Up to 10% for total KC
- 10% for Venator bow ([see below](barbarian-assault.md#venator-bow))
- 10% more points for completion of Kandarin hard diary (upon return of trip)

## BiS Melee Gear

You have a 1/4 chance per trip for your minion to be chosen as the Fighter role. If you are chosen for this role, your melee gear will provide a boost of up to 13.11%. If you are not chosen for this role, you simply don't get the gear score boost. This boost is based on your minions _melee strength bonus_ and below is an image of the best melee strength bonus currently available:

**NOTE:** Using Bandos chestplate and tassets with Neitiznot faceguard will give 12.50% boost.

## **Honour Level**

To spend your honour points to increase your honour level, use the following command:

- `/minigames barb_assault level`

| **Level** | **Honour Point Cost** | **Honour Level Boost** |
| --------- | :-------------------: | :--------------------: |
| Level 1   |           0           |         6.06%          |
| Level 2   |          800          |         12.12%         |
| Level 3   |         1,200         |         18.18%         |
| Level 4   |         1,600         |         24.24%         |
| Level 5   |         2,000         |         30.3%          |

## Venator Bow

You can create the Venator bow using `/create` (needs 5 venator shards). Unlike the melee gear boost, the bow will provide a 10% speed boost to every trip. It must be equipped in range and [charged](../miscellaneous/charging-items.md#venator-bow) for the boost to apply, and will degrade at a rate of 50 charges per wave.
