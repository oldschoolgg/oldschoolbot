title: "Barbarian Assault"
---

Challenge waves of Penance monsters to unlock the rewards from Barbarian Assault. BA in the bot works a bit differently than in OSRS, as it is only soloable and the rest of your team members are essentially NPCs. There are no defined roles or role-specific honour levels, and there aren't even specific waves. However, you have a 25% chance to be selected as the Fighter role. When this happens, you'll get a speed boost based on your melee gear ([see below](barbarian-assault#bis-melee-gear)).

To start a trip of BA:
[[/minigames barb_assault start]]

## Boosts

- Up to 13.11% for melee gear ([see below](barbarian-assault#bis-melee-gear))
- Up to 30.3% for honour level ([see below](barbarian-assault#honour-level))
- Up to 10% for total KC
- 10% for Venator bow ([see below](barbarian-assault#venator-bow))
- 10% more points for completion of Kandarin hard diary (applies on trip return)

## BiS Melee Gear

You have a 1/4 chance per trip to be chosen as the Fighter role. If chosen, your melee gear provides up to a 13.11% boost based on your minion’s **melee strength bonus**.

**Note:** Using Bandos chestplate and tassets with Neitiznot faceguard gives a 12.50% boost.

## Honour Level

To spend honour points and increase your honour level:
[[/minigames barb_assault level]]

| **Level** | **Honour Point Cost** | **Honour Level Boost** |
| --------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Level 1   | 0                     | 6.06%                  |
| Level 2   | 800                   | 12.12%                 |
| Level 3   | 1,200                 | 18.18%                 |
| Level 4   | 1,600                 | 24.24%                 |
| Level 5   | 2,000                 | 30.3%                  |

## Venator Bow

You can create the Venator bow using [[/create]] (requires 5 Venator shards). Unlike the melee gear boost, the bow provides a flat 10% speed boost on every trip. It must be equipped in the range slot and [charged](../miscellaneous/charging-items#venator-bow) for the boost to apply. It degrades at a rate of 50 charges per wave.
