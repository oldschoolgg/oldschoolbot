title: "Last Man Standing"

Last Man Standing (LMS) is a solo minigame where you fight other players (i.e. NPCs) to gain points and, as the name suggests, be the last player alive. There are no boosts or requirements to start this minigame.

Your minion will continuously improve at LMS every game until it has played 120 games in total. After 120 games, the minion's win rate will be about 7Ã— that of a minion with 0 games played.

Be aware that [[/minigames lms simulate]] is **NOT** the same.

## Rewards

You can spend your hard-earned points at the LMS shop. Use the command:  
[[/minigames lms buy name\:(item name)]]

You need 4,130 points to acquire all rewards (excluding capes).
