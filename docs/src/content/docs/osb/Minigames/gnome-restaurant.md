title: "Gnome Restaurant"
---

Gnome Restaurant is a solo minigame in which you can gain some fancy collectibles by delivering presents around the map. It's a fairly slow minigame, so, it is recommended that you have some of the boosts which will make things much smoother.

To start the minigame, use `/minigames gnome_restaurant start`

## Requirements

- 5,000gp - required every trip
- 5-6 Law runes - ONLY if you have 66 Magic or above.

## **Jewellery Items**

The bot will randomly choose between a piece of jewellery to use every trip. If the bot chooses jewellery that you don't have, you won't get the 20% boost, even if you have the others.

**Example:** You only have a charged dueling ring and charged glory. The bot chooses to use a games necklace for this trip. You will not get the 20% boost.

**What happens to my jewellery?**

- Ring of dueling - Consumed and not returned
- Games necklace - Consumed and not returned
- Amulet of glory - Returned with no charges (currently the only method to use up charges)
- Amulet of eternal glory - Returned with no harm done
