title: "Shades Of Mort'ton"
---

The Shades of Mort'ton minigame works in a condensed manner compared to OSRS. Basically, your minion only needs logs and shade remains to send trips. No need to collect sacred oil or burn the shades yourself, it's all done in the one trip. There are no skill requirements to start Shades of Mort'ton.

To start a trip of the minigame, use the following:

- `/minigames shades_of_morton start`` `**`shade:`**`[shadeType]`` `**`logs:`**`[logType]`

## Shade Remains

You can kill shades by using the `/k` command. When burned, each shade will give either a key or coins. In order from lowest to higher tier, they are:

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |

## Burning Shade Remains

Certain logs can only be used for certain shades. For example, using a redwood log will allow you to burn any type of shade remain, but a regular log will only allow you to burn Loar and Phrin shade remains. Using a higher tier log will also yield more xp for burning lower level shades. Refer to the table below.

|                  |                                                                                         |                             |
