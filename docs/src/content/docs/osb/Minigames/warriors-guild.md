# Warriors Guild

You can use the Warriors Guild to get defenders, powerful offensive offhand slot items. You can use sets of black, mithril, adamant, or rune armour to earn guild tokens command. Once you have tokens, you can fight the cyclopes housed in the guild to earn bronze through dragon defenders. You are required to have at least 100 tokens before killing the cyclopes. You can also get more than one defender in one trip.

To collect warriors guild tokens:

- `/activities warriors_guild`` `**`action:`**`tokens`

To kill cyclops for defenders:

- `/activities warriors_guild`` `**`action:`**`cyclops`
