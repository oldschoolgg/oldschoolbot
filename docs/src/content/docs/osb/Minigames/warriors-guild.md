title: "Warriors Guild"
---

The Warriors Guild is used to obtain **defenders**, powerful offhand items. You earn **Warrior’s Guild tokens** by using sets of black, mithril, adamant, or rune armour, then spend tokens to fight **Cyclopes**, which drop defenders from bronze to dragon.

To collect tokens:  
[[/activities warriors_guild action\:tokens]]

To fight Cyclopes:  
[[/activities warriors_guild action\:cyclops]]

---

## Requirements

- Full helm, platebody, and platelegs of one of the listed armour sets
- At least 100 tokens to fight Cyclopes

> You can earn multiple defenders per trip.  
> Do **not** equip defenders until you have a Dragon Defender — the command checks your **bank**, not equipped gear.
