## Rewards

To buy rewards with your tokens, use `/minigames temple_trek buy`

- E.g. `/minigames temple_trek buy reward:Experience difficulty:Hard`

Rewards are same as in game. The treks themselves drop nails from nail beasts and remains from shades, as well as [Lumberjack outfit](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/skills/woodcutting#lumberjack-outfit). It's possible to get dupes of lumberjack after you get the full set.
