title: "Miscellania"
---

The Kingdom of Miscellania lets your minion gather resources each day in exchange for GP. Your workers take a small portion of coins from your coffer daily and convert it into various resources depending on how they are assigned.

## Managing your kingdom

- Deposit GP with `[/activities miscellania deposit amount:]`. Keeping more coins in the coffer improves worker efficiency. Without completing **Royal Trouble** your coffer is limited to 5,000,000 GP. Meeting its requirements increases the cap to 7,500,000 GP.
- Check your current **approval**, **coffer balance** and how many days have passed since you last collected using `[/activities miscellania status]`.
- Send your minion to regain approval with `[/activities miscellania approval]` if it has dropped below 100%. Higher approval results in better resource yields.
- Gather the resources your kingdom has produced with `[/activities miscellania collect]`. You will only receive loot for full days that have passed since your last collection.
- Assign workers to different tasks with `[/activities miscellania allocate]` to customise your daily resource mix.

## What do you get?

Every day a small amount of GP is withdrawn (5 GP plus 10% of your remaining coffer, up to 50k or 75k depending on whether Royal Trouble is complete). This determines your worker effectiveness. By default you have ten workers split evenly between **woodcutting** and **mining**. They can also gather fish, herbs, seeds, flax and hardwood. The resources you receive scale with your approval and the GP spent.

You can preview potential loot using the simulation command. By default it assumes full approval and the
standard worker split, but you can customise these. For example:
`[/simulate miscellania days:7 approval:80 ten_workers:herbs five_workers:mining]`
would show a week of loot with 80% approval, assigning ten workers to herbs and five to mining.

Make sure to top up your coffer and maintain your approval to keep your kingdom running efficiently!
