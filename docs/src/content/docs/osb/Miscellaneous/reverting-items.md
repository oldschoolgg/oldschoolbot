title: "Reverting Items"
---

In most cases, reverting items is only necessary if you're aiming to:

- Sell an item that became untradeable due to ornamentation or charging
- Break down an item into components (e.g., Bandos or Zulrah gear)
- Revert recoloured or transmogged pets
- Convert Castle Wars items back into tickets

To revert an item, use:  
[[/create item\:revert]]  
Then select the item you want to revert into one of the following:

- Components
- Original item (removes ornament or separates combined items)
- Recoloured/transmogged pets
- Tickets (Castle Wars)

**Reverting items with charges will NOT delete the charges. Charges are bound to your minion, not the item.**

### Component Reverts

These items return components when reverted:

- Tanzanite fang or Toxic blowpipe (empty) → 20,000 Zulrah scales
- Magic fang → 20,000 Zulrah scales
- Serpentine helm or Uncharged serpentine helm → 20,000 Zulrah scales
- Bandos chestplate → 3 Bandosian components
- Bandos tassets → 2 Bandosian components
- Armadyl helmet → 1 Armadylean plate
- Armadyl chestplate → 4 Armadylean plates
- Armadyl chainskirt → 3 Armadylean plates
- Ancient icon → 5,000 Ancient essence
- Venator shard → 50,000 Ancient essence
- Uncharged wildy weapons → 7,500 Revenant ether
- Xeric's talisman (inert) → 100 Lizardman fangs
- Slayer helmet → All components of the slayer helm
- Themed slayer helmets → The recolour item and/or the slayer helm

### Ornament Kit Reverts

You get back the ornament kit (or component) when reverting:

- Zenyte items (Tormented, Anguish, Torture)
- Godswords (Bandos, Armadyl, Zamorak, Saradomin)
- Scythe of Vitur (Sanguine, Holy)
- Sanguinesti staff (Sanguine, Holy)
- Ghrazi rapier (Sanguine, Holy)
- Dragon items (Defender, Pickaxe, Sq shield, Full helm, Platebody, Kiteshield, Boots, Scimitar, Platelegs, Plateskirt, Chainbody)
- Nightmare staffs (Eldritch, Volatile, Harmonised) — returns the orb and base staff
- Ferocious gloves (Hydra leather)
- Tzhaar-ket-om (t)

### Castle Wars Tickets

Castle Wars items can be reverted into the full amount of tickets originally used.  
See [Castle Wars](../minigames/castle-wars.md) for info on how to obtain and spend tickets.

### Special Case

Reverting the following returns **only** the original item:

- [[/create item\:revert Dragon Pickaxe (upgraded)]] → returns only the Dragon Pickaxe (no kit or extra item)
