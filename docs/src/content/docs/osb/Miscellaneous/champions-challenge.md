title: "Champions Challenge"
---

Take on one of the greatest challenges in OSRS by obtaining all 10 Champion scrolls to secure the elusive [[Champion's cape]]. While not as difficult as in the real game, it can still take many days, weeks, or even months to collect all the scrolls.

The challenges work slightly differently in the bot. You only need to collect all 10 scrolls, rather than kill all 10 champions separately. 

Once you have all 10 scrolls, simply run the following command to receive the cape: [[/activities other activity\:Champions Challenge]].

You cannot fail the challenge.
