The bot has it's own GE system which functions almost identically to how it does in the real game. Only tradable items can be bought and sold. Ironmen cannot use this function. Others things to be aware of:

- The maximum price per item is 1000b. The maximum total price per listing is the same.
- The maximum quantity per item listing is 5m.
- When buying or selling, the price flag is per item, not total price.
- 1% of all sales are deducted automatically which acts as a gold sink.
- There are buy limits (which resets every 4 hours).
- Market prices are not available on all items. The average price is based on a weekly average.
- You currently cannot see other players active offers.
- You will be DM'ed by the bot when your item has bought/sold.
- These DMs can be toggle off through [[/config user toggle]]
