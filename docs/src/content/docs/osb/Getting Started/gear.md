title: "Gear"
---

Your minion has 8 gear setups (Melee, Mage, Range, Skilling, Misc, Wildy, Fashion and Other) in which you can equip your gear into depending on what activity you want to do on the bot. Below is a list of the commands that deal with equip and unequipping gear on your minion. Lets say you just finished questing and bought yourself a pair of barrows gloves and you want to equip those in your range setup, you would type `/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**`Range`` `**`item:`**`Barrows gloves` . Now lets say you already had a pair of mithril gloves equipped in your range setup and you wanted to equip the barrows gloves instead now, you do not need to unequip the other gloves first, the equip command will take the other pair off for you and equip the new item. Further below we will talk about gearpresets, a way for you to save a setup you like for later for easy equipping (Please note that the some gear setups are locked to T3 Patron or higher).

## Commands

There are 4 options: `/gear equip`, `/gear unequip`, `/gear stats` and `/gear pet`. You can simply type `/gear` for all 4 of these options to appear.

### Gear Equip

The `/gear equip` command lets you equip and change gear. You will firstly select the gear setup you wish to edit. There are 4 options under it:

|             |                                                                  |                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Command** | **What it does**                                                 | **Example**                                                                                |
| Item        | Selects a single item you wish to equip.                         | `/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**`Melee`` `**`item:`**`Barrows gloves`                     |
| Preset      | Selects a previously made or default gear preset to equip.       | `/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**`Skilling`` `**`preset:`**`graceful`                      |
| Quantity    | Selects a specific number of an item to equip (ammunition only). | `/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**`Range`` `**`item:`**`Rune arrow`` `**`quantity:`**`1000` |
| Auto        | Selects the BiS equipment for a specific attack style.           | `/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**`Melee`` `**`auto:`**`melee_strength`                     |

### Gear Unequip

You can use this command to unequip items from any gear setup. There are 2 options: unequip all the items from a specific setup, or just 1 item at a time.

### Gear Stats

This is simply for simulation of equipping items and checking the stats of a particular setup. You do not need to own the items to perform this command, but you will need the items full name.

### Gear Pet

Use this command to simply equip or unequip a pet. You can equip and unequip a pet during a trip.

- `/gear pet`` `**`equip:`**` ``[petName]`
- `/gear pet`` `**`unequip:`**` ``true`

## Gear Presets

The `/gearpresets` command gives you the ability to save a particular gear setup for quick-equipping if you decide to switch between content. By default, you are restricted to having 3 gear presets. However, this can be increased if you are a patron or a github supporter.

- Tier 1 - 7 presets
- Tier 2 - 9 presets
- Tier 3+ - 11 presets

| **Command** | **What it does**                                                                                     | **Example**                                                                    |

## BiS Gear

<div align="left">

</div>

This gear is the best food reduction equipment in the game. This will save the highest amount of food possible at almost every boss, with notable exceptions being KQ and [Nightmare](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/nightmare-of-ashihama).

### Wildy Setup

The wilderness setup is currently used at the Wilderness Bosses, Revenants and doing Wilderness Hunter and Slayer. Items equipped in this setup can be **permanently lost** if you are killed while doing activities that use this setup (hunter activities ONLY risk shirt and pants item slots). Read more about death chance and mechanics on their respective pages.
