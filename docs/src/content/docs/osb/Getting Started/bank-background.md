In order to change your bank background one of the first things you will need to do is start by going into the bot and typing `/minion bankbg`` `**`name:`** from there you will be presented with an in depth list of all the available backgrounds to you as either a non patron up to a T5 patron. As you go down the list of bank backgrounds you will notice that some of them are exclusive to T3 through T5 patron or unavailable entirely, that list is as follows:
