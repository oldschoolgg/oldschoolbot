title: "Combat Training"
---

While strength can be trained through barbarian fishing and magic has various non-combat uses, PvM is a more efficient and profitable way to level up combat stats.

To train combat, use:  
[[/minion train style\:shared]] (or choose another style)

### Combat Styles

- [[/minion train style\:shared]] – XP split equally between attack, strength, and defence
- [[/minion train style\:attack]]
- [[/minion train style\:strength]]
- [[/minion train style\:defence]]
- [[/minion train style\:strength attack]] – Trains strength and attack
- [[/minion train style\:defence attack]] – Trains defence and attack
- [[/minion train style\:strength defence]] – Trains strength and defence
- [[/minion train style\:ranged]]
- [[/minion train style\:ranged defence]] – Trains ranged and defence
- [[/minion train style\:magic]]
- [[/minion train style\:magic defence]] – Trains magic and defence

**Note:** hitpoints XP is always gained alongside any style and cannot be directly trained.

You can choose a fixed style or leave it in default mode (based on the monster attacked).  
Once changed, you cannot revert to default mode, but there is no benefit to doing so anyway.

XP is based on the HP of the monster being killed. The best XP/hr comes from monsters like Giant Spiders, Fire Giants, and Greater Nechryaels.  
Training combat alongside Slayer is advised for efficiency.

## Food

### Favourite Food

When PvMing, your minion consumes food from your bank starting from **lowest healing** to **highest**.  
This means items like Jugs of Wine (from Cooking training) are used first unless specified otherwise.

To set/remove prioritized food:  
[[/config user favorite_food]]

### Food Boosts

Some foods boost trip speed. Jug of wine is the only food that gives a **penalty**.

| Food        | Boost |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Jug of wine | -10%  |
| Monkfish    | +1%   |
| Shark       | +2%   |
| Sea turtle  | +2%   |
| Manta ray   | +3%   |
| Dark crab   | +3%   |
| Anglerfish  | +4%   |
