# Combat Training

While strength can be leveled through barbarian fishing and magic has various non-combat applications, PvM is a more efficient and profitable way to level up your combat stats.

By using the `/minion train` command, you can select which style of combat you would like to level. Here is a list of all possible combat styles:

- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``shared` - provides equally split xp to all 3 melee styles
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``attack`
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``strength`
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``defence`
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``strength attack` - trains strength + attack together
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``defence attack` - trains defence + attack together
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``strength defence` - trains strength + defence together
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``ranged`
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``ranged defence` - trains ranged + defence together
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``magic`
- `/minion train`` `**`style:`**` ``magic defence` - trains magic + defence together

**Note:** Hitpoints xp is gained alongside any combat style and cannot be selected as a primary training focus.

You can leave this in the default mode where your style will change depending on the mob you are attacking, or you can specify a specific combat skill to train in. You cannot change it back to the default mode, however, there is no real need to as it provides no benefits over other styles.

The amount of xp you gain is based off of the hitpoints of the monster you're killing, and the hourly rate can vary from monster to monster. Giant spiders, Fire giants, and Greater nechryaels offer the fastest combat experience in the game, but it is advisable to train combat stats alongside slayer.

## Food

#### Favourite Food

When PvMing, you will consume any food you currently have in your bank. The consumption of your food is used from **lowest healing** to **highest healing**. Because of this mechanic, any jugs of wine you create during cooking training will be used before many other high tier foods.

To set and remove prioritised food when PvMing, you can use the following command:

- `/config user favorite_food`

#### Food Boosts

Certain foods give boosts to the trip time during PvM. Jug of wine is the only food to give a **penalty** instead of a boost.

|             |      |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Jug of wine | -10% |
| Monkfish    | 1%   |
| Shark       | 2%   |
| Sea turtle  | 2%   |
| Manta ray   | 3%   |
| Dark crab   | 3%   |
| Anglerfish  | 4%   |
