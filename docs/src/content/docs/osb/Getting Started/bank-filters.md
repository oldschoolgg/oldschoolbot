title: "Bank Filters"
---

There are a multitude of bank filters you can use to easily identify or search items in your bank. You can start by typing the `/bank` command to display your bank. It is also possible to view the different pages of your bank with `/bank`` `**`page:`**`X` (X being any page number).

### Searching Your Bank

There are 2 ways to search your bank for items.

- `/bank`` `**`item:`**`[item name]`
  - This command only returns results when the full item name is entered.
- `/bank`` `**`search:`**`[text]`
  - This command will return anything that contains the text entered.

### Bank Sorting

When searching your bank you can use multiple options to find exactly what you're looking for.

#### Sorts:

- `value` - this is the default sort by grand exchange value (then item ID for untradeables)
- `alch` - sorts by alch value rather than grand exchange value
- `name` - sorts your bank alphabetically
- `quantity` - sorts your bank by item stack size

#### Flags:

- `show_X` - this will show whatever option is chosen (id, alch price, names, etc) below the item
- `wide`- makes the image wider (useful for viewing a lot of items at once)
- `show_all` - includes all items rather than a single page (this can result in very large images)

#### Formats:

- `text_paged` - returns a click-through box similar to leaderboards for your bank
- `text_full`- returns a notepad document of all items (very useful for viewing a large bank)
- `json` - returns a json file of your bank

The following command is an example of a bank search for the term "rune" with many filters.

- E.g. `/bank`` `**`search:`**`rune`` `**`flag:`**`show_names`` `**`flag_extra:`**`wide`
