title: "Hallowed Sepulchre"
---

The Hallowed Sepulchre is an [[agility]] minigame where you can unlock the Dark Graceful outfit, the [[Dark squirrel]] recolor, the [[Strange old lockpick]], and the [[Ring of endurance]]. With all available boosts, it is possible to achieve upwards of [[agility:90k XP]] per hour while doing Floor 5.

To start the Sepulchre, use [[/minigames sepulchre start]].

## Requirements

- Any set of Graceful — **must be equipped in the skilling setup**
- [[thieving:66]]
- [[agility:52]], and higher levels provide better rewards, including [[Hallowed mark]]:
  - Floor 1 – [[agility:52]]
  - Floor 2 – [[agility:62]]
  - Floor 3 – [[agility:72]]
  - Floor 4 – [[agility:82]]
  - Floor 5 – [[agility:92]]

## Boosts

Most of the boosts come from items purchased from the shop.

- 4% boost for [[Hallowed grapple]]
- 4% boost for [[Hallowed focus]]
- 4% boost for [[Hallowed symbol]]
- 4% boost for [[Hallowed hammer]]
- 1% boost for [[Strange old lockpick]]
- Up to 10% for minion learning (1 hour of minigame = 1%)

**Note:** The [[Hallowed ring]] from the shop does **not** provide a boost or benefit.

## Zero-time Alching and Fletching

See the [Zero-time Activities guide](/osb/miscellaneous/zero-time-activities) for full configuration steps. When you're ready to start [[/minigames sepulchre start]], set things up beforehand so each floor automatically triggers the background action you prefer.

- Zero-time alching inside the Sepulchre performs roughly 1,000 casts per hour.
- Zero-time fletching uses each item's standard zero-time rate (around 18,000 sets/hour for darts and bolts, ~10,000 for arrows, javelins, tipped bolts, and similar ammunition).

All casts or fletched items happen between obstacles without delaying your run. Leave the alch item unset if you want the bot to choose from your favourite alchs on every trip.

| [[Dark acorn]]             |            3,000            | Used to transmogrify the [[Dark squirrel]]  |

- If you have obtained a [[Giant squirrel]], you can [[/buy name\:Dark squirrel]] after purchasing the [[Dark acorn]] from the shop to transmogrify the pet.

## Mysterious Pages

There are 5 pages in total, one for each floor. These pages are given at a 1/10 chance when completing a floor. You cannot get duplicates (unless you obtained more than one in the same trip you first obtained the page).

## Dark Graceful Set

- The Dark Graceful set can be acquired by purchasing the [[Dark dye]] from the shop. It requires a full set of the base Graceful and one dye per piece.
- To create the set, use [[/create item\:Dark graceful]].
- You need 6 Dark dyes to create the full set, totaling 1,800 [[Hallowed mark]].
- To revert the set, use [[/create item\:Revert dark graceful]].

## Strange Old Lockpick

The [[Strange old lockpick]] provides boosts to several places in the bot, namely Barrows and Hallowed Sepulchre, as it has a purpose in those locations in-game. However, unlike its in-game counterpart, the [[Strange old lockpick]] is **untradeable** in the bot and has **infinite charges**. Because of this, its drop rate is significantly lower than in-game, increasing its rarity.

| **Floor** | **Drop Rate** |
| --------- | :-----------: |
| Floor 1   |    1/2,000    |
| Floor 2   |    1/1,500    |
| Floor 3   |    1/1,100    |
| Floor 4   |     1/800     |
| Floor 5   |     1/600     |

- These rates are calculated **by chest**, not by floor. The number of chests on each floor can be found [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Coffin_(Hallowed_Sepulchre)#Locations) on the OSRS Wiki. This means that while doing the Hallowed Sepulchre at [[agility:92]], you will have an approximately 1/150 chance of receiving a [[Strange old lockpick]] each lap.

## Ring of Endurance

The [[Ring of endurance]] also provides boosts to several activities within the bot. Some activities require a charged version, while others only require the uncharged version. To create the charged Ring of Endurance, use [[/create item\:Ring of endurance]]. This requires 125 [[Stamina potion(4)]].

> Once the ring is charged, it CANNOT be reverted or traded!

The boosts apply to the following activities:

- Runecrafting trips – 1% _(must be charged)_
- Underwater Agility – 6%
- Drift net fishing – 6%
- Farming trips – 10% _(must be charged and equipped in any setup)_
