| Item name                  | Cost of dust |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Celestial ring (uncharged) | 2000         |
| Star fragment              | 3000         |
| Bag full of gems           | 300          |
| Soft clay pack             | 150          |

## Celestial Signet

The Celestial ring can be combined with the Elven signet to make the Celestial signet. The Celestial signet performs in the exact same way the Celestial ring does, giving an invisible +4 boost to the players mining level. Charging the ring doesn't add any extra effects or give any benefits, however, the ring needs to have at least 1 charge to be able to combine it with the Elven signet. It also requires an additional 1,000 stardust and 100 crystal shards to combine.
