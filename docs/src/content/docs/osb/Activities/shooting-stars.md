title: "Shooting Stars"
---

Shooting Stars is a [[mining]] activity. A star can spawn after any trip, and you will see a button to start the activity. The star will spawn at a random tier; the higher the tier, the higher the Mining level you will need.

Start this trip by clicking the `Mine Crashed Star` button when you see it on a return trip message.

## Requirements

| Star Size | Mining Level Required |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| 1         | [[mining:10]]         |
| 2         | [[mining:20]]         |
| 3         | [[mining:30]]         |
| 4         | [[mining:40]]         |
| 5         | [[mining:50]]         |
| 6         | [[mining:60]]         |
| 7         | [[mining:70]]         |
| 8         | [[mining:80]]         |
| 9         | [[mining:90]]         |

## Rewards

- Each star you mine will give you [[star dust]].
- You can buy the following items using the [[/buy]] command.

| Item Name                       | Cost of Dust |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [[Celestial ring (uncharged)]]  | 2,000        |
| [[Star fragment]]               | 3,000        |
| [[Bag full of gems]]            | 300          |
| [[Soft clay pack]]              | 150          |

## Celestial Signet

- The [[Celestial ring]] can be combined with the [[Elven signet]] to make the [[Celestial signet]]. This requires an additional 1,000 [[star dust]] and 100 [[crystal shard]].
- The [[Celestial signet]] performs in the exact same way as the [[Celestial ring]], giving an invisible +4 boost to the player's [[mining]] level.
- Charging the ring doesn't add any extra effects or give any benefits; however, the ring needs to have at least 1 charge to be able to combine it with the [[Elven signet]].
- Charge the [[Celestial ring (uncharged)]] using [[/minion charge item\:Celestial ring amount\:1]], then create the [[Celestial signet]] using [[/create item\: Celestial signet]].
