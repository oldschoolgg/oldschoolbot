title: "Shooting stars"
---

Shooting stars is a mining activity. A star can spawn after any trip, and you will see a button to start the activity. The star will spawn at a random tier, the higher the tier, the higher the mining level you will need.

Start this trip by clicking the `Mine Crashed Star` button when you see it on a return trip message.

## Requirements

| Star Size | Mining level required |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| 1         | [[mining:10]]         |
| 2         | [[mining:20]]         |
| 3         | [[mining:30]]         |
| 4         | [[mining:40]]         |
| 5         | [[mining:50]]         |
| 6         | [[mining:60]]         |
| 7         | [[mining:70]]         |
| 8         | [[mining:80]]         |

## **Rewards**

- Each star you mine will give you [[star dust]]. 
- You can buy the following items using the [[/buy]] command.

| Item name                      | Cost of dust |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| [[Celestial ring (uncharged)]] | 2000         |
| [[Star fragment]]              | 3000         |
| [[Bag full of gems]]           | 300          |
| [[Soft clay pack]]             | 150          |

## Celestial Signet

- The [[Celestial ring]] can be combined with the [[Elven signet]] to make the [[Celestial signet]]. This requires an additional 1,000 [[stardust]] and 100 [[crystal shard]]. 
- The [[Celestial signet]] performs in the exact same way the [[Celestial ring]] does, giving an invisible +4 boost to the players mining level. 
- Charging the ring doesn't add any extra effects or give any benefits, however, the ring needs to have at least 1 charge to be able to combine it with the [[Elven signet]]. 
- Charge the [[Celestial ring (Uncharged)]] using [[/minion charge item\:Celestial ring amount\:1]], then create the [[Celestial signet]] using [[/create item\: Celestial signet]].
