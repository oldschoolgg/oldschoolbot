title: "Drift Net Fishing"
---

Drift net fishing is an efficient method for training [[fishing]] and [[hunter]] simultaneously.
XP rates vary based on level:

- ~100k [[hunter]] XP/hr and 75k [[fishing]] XP/hr at lower levels
- Up to 135k [[hunter]] XP/hr and 100k [[fishing]] XP/hr at higher levels
- ±10–15k XP/hr variation is normal

Start a trip with:
[[/activities driftnet_fishing minutes\:X]]
_Replace X with the number of minutes. Less time = fewer nets required._

## Requirements

- [[hunter:44]]
- [[fishing:47]]
- Graceful top, legs, and gloves (equipped in any setup)
- Merfolk trident **or** Uncharged trident (equipped in any setup)
- 30+ Drift nets (requires [[crafting:26]])
  - Created with jute fibres: [[/craft name\:Drift net]]

## Boosts

- +6%: Ring of endurance (either version; works from bank)
- +30%: Stamina potion(4) — **must be 4-dose**
  - Skip staminas with: `no_stams:true` (you lose the 30% boost)
- -50%: Not wearing Flippers (equip in any setup)

## Rewards

  - [[fishing:50]] — Raw lobster
  - [[fishing:60]] — Raw swordfish
  - [[fishing:70]] — Raw shark
  - [[fishing:80]] — Raw sea turtle
  - [[fishing:90]] — Raw manta ray

## Training

## Fastest Route to 99

[[/fish name\:Shrimps]] from [[fishing:1]]–[[fishing:5]]
[[/fish name\:Sardine]] from [[fishing:5]]–[[fishing:10]] (requires fishing bait)
[[/fish name\:Herring]] from [[fishing:10]]–[[fishing:20]] (requires fishing bait)
**OPTIONAL:** Fishing Trawler for Angler outfit
[[/fish name\:Trout]] from [[fishing:20]]–[[fishing:30]] (requires feathers)
[[/fish name\:Salmon]] from [[fishing:30]]–[[fishing:58]] (requires feathers)
**OPTIONAL:** Aerial Fishing (requires minimum [[hunter:35]]) for Pearl barbarian rod
[[/fish name\:Barbarian fishing]] from [[fishing:58]]–[[fishing:71]] (requires feathers)

[[/k name\:tempoross]] from [[fishing:71]]–[[fishing:99]] using a crystal harpoon

[Tempoross](tempoross.md) is a faster option than Barbarian Fishing once you have a crystal tool seed (from Zalcano) and a Dragon harpoon (from Wyrms or Tempoross) to create a crystal harpoon. Requires [[fishing:35]]. Tempoross also provides large amounts of raw food for ironmen.

Alternatively, continuing Barbarian Fishing is the cheaper and next-best method to reach 99.

### Best Pet Chance

Currently, the fastest pet method is fishing Karambwans.

### Additional Information

[Aerial Fishing](aerial-fishing.md) at [[fishing:43]]/[[hunter:35]] is more efficient than training Hunting or Fishing separately if your goal is 99 in both.
