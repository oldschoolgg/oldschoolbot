title: "Wintertodt"
---

You can train Firemaking via the Wintertodt minigame using the command below. You will get Firemaking XP scaled to your level, and slightly better xp for higher Woodcutting and Construction levels. It is recommended to get at least [[construction:20]] before you start.

To start this activity, use [[/k name\:Wintertodt]].

## Requirements

- [[firemaking:50]]
- At least 160hp worth of food per kill (if not wearing warm clothing). The bot will automatically use lower quality food first

## Boosts

- Up to 10% for your Woodcutting level (0.1% each level)
- Up to 37.5% food reduction for warm clothing

## Warm Clothing

While optional, it is highly advised to equip **at least 4 pieces** of [warm clothing](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wintertodt/Warm_clothing) **in your skilling setup** to reduce your food consumption by up to 37.5%. This will take your food consumption down from 160hp/kill, to 100hp/kill. The easiest warm gear you can obtain on the bot is Clue hunter, to do this see [Crack The Clue](/osb/miscellaneous/crack-the-clue/).

## Rewards

Fighting the Wintertodt provides item rewards scaled to your Woodcutting, Mining, Fishing, Farming, Crafting, and Herblore levels. You can obtain all regular uniques at the same rate as the real game.

- You will receive the Pyro pieces in the following order: Garb > Hood > Robe > Boots.
- If you own 3 pairs of [[warm gloves]] and roll a 4th or more, you will receive a [[Magic seed]] instead.
- If you own 3 [[bruma torch]] and roll a 4th or more, you will receive a [[Torstol seed]] instead.

### Phoenix Pet

The [[Phoenix]] pet is also obtainable at a 1/5000 per roll. At [[firemaking:200m XP]], your odds are increased 15x, meaning your chances are drastically improved to 1/333.
