title: "Wintertodt"
---

You can train [[firemaking]] via the Wintertodt minigame using the command below. You will get [[firemaking]] XP scaled to your level, with slightly better XP for higher [[woodcutting]] and [[construction]] levels. It is recommended to get at least [[construction:20]] before you start.

To start this activity, use [[/k name\:Wintertodt]].

## Requirements

- [[firemaking:50]]
- At least 160 HP worth of food per kill (if not wearing warm clothing). The bot will automatically use lower-quality food first.

## Boosts

- Up to 10% for your Woodcutting level (0.1% per level)
- Up to 37.5% food reduction for warm clothing

## Warm Clothing

While optional, it is highly advised to equip **at least 4 pieces** of [warm clothing](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wintertodt/Warm_clothing) **in your skilling setup** to reduce your food consumption by up to 37.5%. This will reduce your food consumption from 160 HP per kill to 100 HP per kill. The easiest warm gear you can obtain on the bot is Clue Hunter; to do this, see [Crack The Clue](/osb/miscellaneous/crack-the-clue/).

## Rewards

Fighting the Wintertodt provides item rewards scaled to your [[woodcutting]], [[mining]], [[fishing]], [[farming]], [[crafting]], and [[herblore]] levels. You can obtain all regular uniques at the same rate as in the real game.

- You will receive the Pyro pieces in the following order: Garb > Hood > Robe > Boots.
- If you own 3 pairs of [[warm gloves]] and roll a 4th or more, you will receive a [[Magic seed]] instead.
- If you own 3 [[bruma torch]] and roll a 4th or more, you will receive a [[Torstol seed]] instead.

### Phoenix Pet

The [[Phoenix]] pet is also obtainable at a rate of 1/5,000 per roll. At [[firemaking:200m XP]], your odds are increased 15x, meaning your chances are drastically improved to 1/333.
