title: "Fountain of Rune"
---

You can use the Fountain of Rune to charge the [[Ring of wealth]] and [[Amulet of glory]]. Be aware that there is a small chance of getting PKed (approximately 1/100 chance), which will result in the loss of an inventory of wealths or glories per death. You will not lose any gear in any setup from this.

You can start this activity using [[/activities charge]]. Note that [[/activities charge quantity\:1]] refers to 1 inventory, or 26 items.

## Charging Wealths

- [[Ring of wealth (5)]] are required to make the [[Ornate jewellery box]] in your POH.

## Charging Glories

- [[Amulet of glory(6)]] are only used in the [Gnome Restaurant](/osb/minigames/gnome-restaurant) minigame.
- Gnome Restaurant is currently the only way to remove charges from a glory.
- If you want to create [[Amulet of glory(4)]], use the [[/activities cast spell\:recharge glory]] command. However, these are not used in Gnome Restaurant and are only used to create the [[Ornate jewellery box]] in your POH.

## Amulet of Eternal Glory

- You can obtain this amulet at a 1/25,000 chance when charging glories here.
- Possessing the stats for the Wilderness Elite diary provides a 3x speed boost.
  - It is **not recommended** to charge glories unless you have this unlocked.
- Currently, the only use of the [[Amulet of Eternal Glory]] is in the [Gnome Restaurant](/osb/minigames/gnome-restaurant) minigame.
