You can use the Fountain of Rune to charge Rings of wealth and Amulets of glory. Be aware that there is a small chance of getting pked (approximately 1/100 chance) which will result in a loss of an invent of wealths/glories per death. You will not lose any gear in any setup from this.

To charge at the Fountain of Rune, use the following command:

- `/activities charge item:[Amulet of glory/Ring of wealth]`

**Note:** quantity refers to 1 inventory (1 invent = 26 items)
