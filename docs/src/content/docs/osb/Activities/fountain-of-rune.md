You can use the Fountain of Rune to charge [[Ring of wealth]] and [[Amulet of glory]]. Be aware that there is a small chance of getting pked (approximately 1/100 chance) which will result in a loss of an invent of wealths/glories per death. You will not lose any gear in any setup from this. 

You can start this activity using [[/activities charge]]. Note that [[/activities charge quantity\: 1]] refers to 1 inventory, or 26 items.

## Charging Wealths

- [[Ring of wealth (5)]] are required to make the [[Ornate jewellery box]] in your POH.

## Charging Glories

- [[Amulet of glory(6)]] are only used in the [Gnome Restaurant](/osb/minigames/gnome-restaurant) minigame.
- Gnome Restaurant is currently the only way to remove charges from a glory.
- If you want to create [[Amulet of glory(4)]], use the [[/activities cast spell\:recharge glory]] command. However, these are not used in Gnome restaurant and are only used to create the [[Ornate jewellery box]] in your POH.

## Amulet of Eternal Glory

- You can obtain this amulet at a 1/25,000 chance when charging glories here.
- Possessing the stats for the Wilderness elite diary provides a 3x speed boost.
  - It is **not recommended** to charge glories unless you have this unlocked.
- Currently, the only use of the [[Amulet of Eternal Glory]] is at the [Gnome Restaurant](/osb/minigames/gnome-restaurant) minigame.
