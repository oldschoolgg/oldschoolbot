You cannot receive clue scrolls from mining here, and you cannot powermine here. The Varrock armour effect does not work here. The xp with all boosts before collecting 100 [[golden nugget]] and [[mining:72]] is roughly [[mining:44k XP]] per hour, whereas after unlocking the upper level, it is around [[mining:54k XP]] per hour. 

To mine here, use [[/mine name\:Motherlode mine]].
