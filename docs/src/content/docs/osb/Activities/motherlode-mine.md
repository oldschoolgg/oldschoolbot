title: "Motherlode Mine"
---

You can choose to mine in Motherlode Mine for a chance to receive [[Golden nugget]]s and a wide variety of ores, requiring [[mining:30]]. You cannot receive clue scrolls from mining here, and you cannot powermine here. The Varrock armour effect does not work here. The XP with all boosts, before collecting 100 [[Golden nugget]] and reaching [[mining:72]], is roughly [[mining:44k XP]] per hour. After unlocking the upper level, it is around [[mining:54k XP]] per hour.

To mine here, use [[/mine name\:Motherlode mine]].
