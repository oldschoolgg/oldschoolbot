title: "Mage Training Arena"
---

Your minion can train [[magic]] in the Mage Training Arena and buy all the regular rewards, such as Infinity gear, wands, [[Bones to peaches]], [[Rune pouch]] and the [[Mage's book]]. The Mage Training Arena is combined into one room and one set of points. A single room costs 45 [[fire rune]], 20 [[nature rune]], 18 [[cosmic rune]], and 14 [[law rune]]. Each room takes 14 minutes to complete and awards 23 Pizazz points. Training in the Mage Training Arena grants around [[magic:25k XP]] per hour.

To start a trip, use [[/minigames mage_training_arena start]]. To check your points, use [[/minigames mage_training_arena points]].
