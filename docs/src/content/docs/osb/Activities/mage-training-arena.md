The Mage Training Arena is combined into 1 room, and 1 set of points. A single room costs 45 fire-, 20 nature-, 18 cosmic- and 14 law runes. Each room takes 14 minutes to complete and awards 23 Pizazz points (100/hr). Training in the Mage Training Arena grants between 23,750-26,250 magic XP/hr.

### Rewards
