title: "Nex"
---

Nex is a high-level boss found in the God Wars Dungeon. Nex can be killed in groups of up to 5 players, for a chance at unique drops such as [[Zaryte crossbow]], Torva armour pieces, and the [[Nexling]] pet. If you obtain damaged Torva items, you can use [[/create]] to repair them into usable gear.

To start a Nex mass, use [[/k name\:Nex]]. You can also kill Nex in a fake mass using [[/k name\:Nex solo\:True]].

## Requirements

- [[Frozen key]]: obtained by defeating one of each God Wars Dungeon boss, and using [[/create item\:Frozen key]].
- [[ranged:90]] [[defence:90]] [[prayer:74]]
- Good range gear in your range setup, including a weapon ([[Armadyl crossbow]], [[Dragon crossbow]], [[Zaryte crossbow]], or [[Twisted bow]]) and ammo ([[Dragon arrow]], [[Rune arrow]], or [[Ruby dragon bolts (e)]]).
- Supplies: 8x [[Saradomin brew(4)]], 5x [[Super restore(4)]], 2x [[Ranging potion(4)]], 1x [[Sanfew serum(4)]], and 600x ammo (regardless of trip length or quantity).
- At least 1,000,000 coins to cover potential deaths.

## Boosts & BIS

- [[Zaryte crossbow]] is the best-in-slot weapon, and [[Armadyl crossbow]] with a spirit shield is better than a [[Twisted bow]].
- Unlocking rigour (use [[/use item\:dexterous prayer scroll]]) gives a boost.
- If using an [[Elysian spirit shield]] or [[Spectral spirit shield]], your maximum trip length will be longer. This mechanic is unique to Nex and allows you to kill more Nex per trip. The time increase is applied per user; for the maximum benefit, everyone in the team needs one.
- [[Spectral spirit shield]] has the best magic defence bonus in the shield slot.
- [[Elysian spirit shield]] reduces death chance by 30%.
- Offence and Defence boosts are based on your gear stats and Nex KC.
