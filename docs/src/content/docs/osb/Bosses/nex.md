title: "Nex"
---

## Requirements

- Frozen Key
- Defeat one of each [God Wars Dungeon Boss](broken-reference) and then use `/create` to create a Frozen Key
- Level 90 Ranged, Level 90 Defence, Level 74 Prayer
- Good range gear in range setup. Including a weapon (Armadyl Crossbow, Dragon Crossbow, Zaryte Crossbow, Twisted Bow) and ammo (Dragon/rune arrows, or Ruby Dragon Bolts (e)).
- Supplies: `8x Saradomin Brew, 5x Super Restore, 2x Ranging Potions, 1x Sanfew Serum, 600x ammo` regardless of trip length/quantity.

## Boosts & BIS

- Rune arrows are negative/slower than dragon arrows.
- Zaryte Crossbow is the best in slot weapon.
- Zaryte vambraces are BIS in gloves slot.
- Rigour (Dexterous Prayer Scroll used) gives a boost.
- If using an Elysian or Spectral, your maximum trip length will be longer! This is a new mechanic not currently used elsewhere. It means you can kill more nex per trip, because they let you sustain for longer. Note: The time is applied per user, e.g. maybe +3 mins per user in the team, for the maximum increase, everyone in the team needs one.
- Spectral has best mage defence bonus in the shield slot.
- Ely reduces death chance by 30%.
- You get faster at killing Nex based on your Offence Boost % (gear) and your KC.

**NOTE**: You can now kill Nex Solo using [[/k name:Nex solo:True]]

## BIS Gear

Zaryte Crossbow + Elysian, Armadyl Crossbow + Ely, Armadyl Crossbow + Spectral, Twisted Bow (Best to worst)
