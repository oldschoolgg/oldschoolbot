title: "Wilderness"
---

The Wilderness is a high-risk, high-reward area featuring some of the most dangerous bosses and activities in the game. You can fight bosses like Callisto, Vet'ion, and Venenatis, as well as Revenants, for a chance at valuable uniques and resources, but risk losing your gear and loot to player killers (PKers).

## PK & Death Chance

There are three PKer peak periods, changing every ~2 hours. The chance to encounter a PKer per minute is:

| PK Peak Times | Callisto, Vet'ion, Venenatis | Artio, Calvarion, Spindel |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Low           | 1.52%                        | 2.85%                     |
| Medium        | 7.59%                        | 14.29%                    |
| High          | 18.98%                       | 35.71%                    |

If you encounter a PKer, you lose some KC and loot. The base chance of being PKed is 10%, modified by:

- Your wildy gear's defensive stats (60% magic, 40% ranged, 20% melee)
- Anti-PK supplies, see [Smite Chance](./#smite-chance)
- Having [[prayer:43]] for overheads
- Your wildy boss experience
- Being in a multi-combat area

### Smite Chance

You need [[prayer:25]] for Protect Item. With the following supplies, the chance of being smited (per death) is 1/300; without, it's 1/20:

- [[Saradomin brew(4)]]: 1 per 4 minutes
- [[Blighted Super restore(4)]]: 1 per 8 minutes
- [[Blighted karambwan]]: 1 per 4 minutes

### Wildy Gear

You always keep your best 4 items (or 3 if smited). Check what you keep or lose with [[/gear view setup\:Lost On Wildy Death]]. Untradeables or 0-value items may not be protected.

## Revenants

Killing Revenants allows you to collect wildy weapons and many high-tier resources, but gives you the highest risk of being PKed.

To start a trip, use (for example) [[/k name\:Revenant imp]].

---

### Boosts

- You get faster kill times based on your attack style bonus (range, magic, or crush). 
- Charged wildy weapon: 35% (must be equipped in wildy setup)
- [[Salve amulet]]: 20% (must be equipped in wildy setup, [[Salve Amulet(ei)]] needed if training range or mage)
- [[Revenant cave teleport]]: 5%

### Uniques

#### Bracelets

A [[Bracelet of ethereum]] can be charged using 2000 [[revenant ether]] but currently has no bot benefit. You can dismantle for 250 [[revenant ether]] each.

- [[/create item\:bracelet of ethereum]]
- [[/create item\:revenant ether]]

#### Revenant Weapons

Charged wildy weapons give boosts at revs and other wildy bosses. Charging costs 7000 [[revenant ether]].

- [[/create item\:viggora's chainmace]]
- [[/create item\:craw's bow]]
- [[/create item\:thammaron's sceptre]]

#### Ancient Items

You can sell ancient items for their OSRS values using [[/sell items\:1 Ancient totem]].

## Wildy Bosses

Killing Callisto, Vet'ion, or Venenatis (and their weaker variants) can risk some of your gear in your wildy setup. **Do not equip items you're not willing to lose.** See [Wildy Gear](./#wildy-gear). You are never skulled, so you keep your best 4 items (or 3 if smited). For info on boosts and requirements for Wilderness bosses, see [monsters](/osb/monsters).

### Voidwaker

Combine all three [[voidwaker]] pieces (obtained from wildy bosses) using [[/create item\:voidwaker]].

### Upgraded Revenant Weapons

You can upgrade and charge revenant weapons using 7000 [[revenant ether]] for better boosts, using the upgrade pieces from wildy bosses.

- [[/create item\:Webweaver bow]]
- [[/create item\:Accursed sceptre]]
- [[/create item\:Ursine chainmace]]
