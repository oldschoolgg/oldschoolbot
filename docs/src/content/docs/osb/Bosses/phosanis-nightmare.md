Phosani's Nightmare is a more difficult; solo-only version of The Nightmare of Ashihama. It drops the same items as the normal Nightmare, as well as the Parasitic egg and the Slepey tablet.
While unique items are rarer from Phosani's Nightmare than they are from the regular Nightmare, Phosani's Nightmare can be killed significantly faster, capping out at 2kc per trip (4kc if patreon).

To kill Phosani's Nightmare, use [[/k name\: Phosani's Nightmare]].

## Boosts

For the staff boost, you can only have 1. The bot will check for an equipped [[Tumeken's shadow]] first, followed by an equipped [[Sanguinesti staff]], and if neither of those are met, the bank is checked for a [[Harmonised nightmare staff]].

6% for [[Tumeken's shadow]] (must be equipped and charged in mage setup, uses 70 charges per kill)

3% for [[Sanguinesti staff]] (must be equipped and charged in mage setup, uses 85 charges per kill)

3% for [[Harmonised nightmare staff]] (works from bank)

3% for [[Elder maul]] (works from bank)

3% for [[Dragon claws]] (works from bank)

Up to 13.2% for equipped melee gear (see below)

You must use the tablet for the boost to apply: [[/use item\: Slepey tablet]]

## BiS Gear

Your melee gear will provide a boost up to 13.2%. This boost is based on each piece of BiS gear you have equipped, with each piece giving 1.2%. Equipping anything that is not BiS, will not grant the 1.2% boost for that slot. Rada's Blessing 4 is BiS for the ammo slot, all other blessings will not suffice.
