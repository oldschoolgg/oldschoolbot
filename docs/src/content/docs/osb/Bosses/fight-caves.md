# Fight Caves

### Overview

You can challenge the Fight Caves and TzTok-Jad to receive a fire cape, tokkul, and the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+fightcaves` command. Better range gear will reduce the time each attempt takes at a rate of roughly 1% per 5 attack value, as will total Jad kc. \
You can equip your best ranged gear with the autoequip command `+autoequip range attack ranged`\
The number of total attempts you have made will determine your chances of killing Jad when he is reached.\
You can make 4 dose potions from 3, 2, and 1 dose drops using the `+decant` command. Should you fail before the final wave, some of your potions will be refunded.

### Requirements & Boosts

- \+160 range bonus equipped to your range gear setup.
- 43 prayer
- 10x Prayer Potion (4), 4x Super Restore (4) and 6x Saradomin Brew (4) per attempt.
- Saradomin Godsword equipped in melee gear setup will reduce your chances of dying before Jad by 4%.

If you have extra fire capes, you can gamble them for an additional roll at the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+capegamble` command.

Tokkul can be spent using the `+tokkulshop` command.

### Survival Chance

Your chance of survival during the fightcaves is calculated based on your number of attempts and whether or not you have a Saradomin Godsword equiped (in any gear setup).
