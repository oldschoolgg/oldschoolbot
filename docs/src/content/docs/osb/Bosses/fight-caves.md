title: "Fight Caves"
---

You can challenge the Fight Caves and TzTok-Jad to receive a [[Fire cape]], [[Tokkul]], and the [[TzRek-Jad]] pet. Better ranged gear will reduce the time each attempt takes at a rate of roughly 1% per 5 ranged attack bonus, as will total TzTok-Jad kill count. You can equip your best ranged gear with the autoequip command [[/gear equip gear_setup\:Range auto\:attack_ranged]]. The number of total attempts you have made will determine your chances of killing TzTok-Jad when he is reached.

You can make 4-dose potions from 3, 2, and 1-dose drops using the [[/activities decant]] command. Should you fail before the final wave, some of your potions will be refunded.

Start the Fight Caves using [[/activities fight_caves]].
