title: "Inferno"
---

The Inferno is a very high-level PvM activity. It has high gear requirements, consumes large amounts of expensive supplies, and attempts can take upwards of 2 hours.

Similar to the Fight Caves, you are not guaranteed to complete the Inferno. Your success chance scales based on your gear, number of attempts, and the number of times you have reached Zuk.

At the end of the Inferno, you are rewarded with an [[Infernal cape]], which is the best-in-slot melee cape in most situations. You also have a chance at obtaining the Inferno's pet, [[Jal-nib-rek]], upon completion and when gambling capes.

> There is also a 1/1,000 chance of receiving the following message if you have made it to Zuk at least once, but never completed the Inferno: _"You made it to TzKal-Zuk X times, but never killed him, maybe just buy the cape JalYt?"_

## Boosts

Boosts for the Inferno are split into two categories: speed and death chance. Speed boosts reduce the time required to complete the Inferno. Death chance boosts reduce your odds of dying before or during the Zuk fight.

Required and boost items **must be equipped** in the relevant setups, except the [[Toxic blowpipe]], which works from your bank.

Negative boosts (e.g., -4.5% for [[Adamant dart]] or -4% for [[Ring of suffering (i)]]) are **beneficial**. They reduce time or death chance. Positive numbers are **harmful**, increasing time or death chance.
