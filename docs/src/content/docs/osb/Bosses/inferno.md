title: "Inferno"
---

The Inferno is a very high-level PvM activity. It has high gear requirements, consumes large amounts of expensive supplies, and attempts can take upwards of 2 hours.

Similar to the Fight Caves, you are not guaranteed to complete the Inferno. Your success chance scales based on your gear, number of attempts, and number of Zuk fights.

At the end of the Inferno, you are rewarded with an [Infernal Cape](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Infernal_cape). This is the best-in-slot melee cape in most situations. You also have a chance at obtaining the Inferno's pet, [Jal-nib-rek](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Jal-nib-rek), upon completion and when gambling Infernal capes.

Tokkul can be spent at the [Tokkul shop](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/fight-caves/tokkul-shop).

> There is also a 1/1,000 chance at receiving the following message if you have made it to Zuk at least once, but never completed the Inferno: _"You made it to TzKal-Zuk X times, but never killed him, maybe just buy the cape JalYt?"_

## Commands

## Boosts

Boosts for the Inferno are split into two categories: speed and death chance. Speed boosts reduce the time required to complete the Inferno. Death chance boosts reduce your odds of dying before or during the Zuk fight.

Unlike most other bosses, required items and boost items **must be equipped** in the relevant setups. The Toxic blowpipe is an exception — it works from your bank.

Boosts listed as negative (e.g. -4.5% for Adamant darts or -4% for Ring of suffering (i)) are **beneficial**. They reduce time or death chance. Positive numbers are **harmful**, increasing time or death chance.

### Speed

- Higher tier darts:
  - Adamant: -4.5%
  - Rune: -5.4%
  - Amethyst: -6.3%
  - Dragon: -7.2%
- Twisted bow: -7.5%
  - ACB increases time by 4.5%
- Unlocking Rigour/Augury: -4% each
  - [[/minion use dexterous prayer scroll]]
  - [[/minion use arcane prayer scroll]]
- On task with Imbued slayer helm/Black mask: -9%  
  (Requires a TzHaar task and 1 Inferno KC)
- Masori body (f) & chaps (f) in range setup: -5%
- Ancestral robe top & bottom in mage setup: -4%

### Death Chance

- Elysian spirit shield in range or mage: -5%
- Ring of suffering (i) in range or mage: -4%
- Justiciar faceguard in range: -5%
- Twisted bow vs ACB: 1.5% (Tbow) vs 7.5% (ACB)

The number of attempts you've done, and the number of times you've fought Zuk, greatly affect speed and death chance.
