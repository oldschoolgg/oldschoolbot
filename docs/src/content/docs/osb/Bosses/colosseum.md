title: "Colosseum"
---

The Colosseum is a wave-based activity where your minion attempts to complete as many waves as possible to earn [[Dizana's Quiver]]. You cannot stop at a specific wave; every run will attempt a full clear.

It takes, on average, 42–43 deaths to complete the Colosseum. The first KC will take approximately 1 hour, but future attempts will become faster at certain KC milestones.

It's advised to use an [[Amulet of Blood Fury]] for your first 10–15 completions, then switch to an [[Amulet of Torture]] to save charges, as your death chance will be lower.

Start a run with [[/k name\:Colosseum]].
