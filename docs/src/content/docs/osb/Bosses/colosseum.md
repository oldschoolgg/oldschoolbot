title: "Colosseum"
---

The Colosseum is a wave-based activity where your minion attempts to complete as many waves as possible to earn Dizana's Quiver. You cannot stop at a specific wave; every run will attempt a full clear.

It takes on average 42–43 deaths to complete the Colosseum. The first KC will take ~1 hour, but future attempts will become faster at certain KC milestones.

It's advised to use Blood Fury for your first 10–15 completions, then switch to Amulet of Torture to save charges, as your death chance will be lower.

> **Note:** Currently, even failing at wave 1 will still use full supplies and charges. A fix is planned, but ETA is unknown.

Start a run with: [[/k name\:Colosseum]]
