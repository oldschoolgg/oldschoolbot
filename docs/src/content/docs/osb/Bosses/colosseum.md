title: "Colosseum"
---

The Colosseum is a wave based activity where your minion will attempt to achieve the highest floor possible, in order to obtain Dizana's quiver. You cannot specify a wave to stop at, you will always attempt to finish the activity.

It takes on average, 42-43 deaths to complete the Colosseum. Your first kc will always take about 1 hour, however, the time after the first completion will drastically reduce, and will continue to do so at certain KC milestones.

It is advised to start your attempts with Blood fury and switch to Torture after 10-15 completions, as this will save charges and your death chance will already be quite low from that point.

> **Currently, even if you plank at wave 1, you will use a full invent of supplies and charges every attempt. There is a fix coming, but the due date is unknown at this time.**

To start the Colosseum, use [[/k name\:Colosseum]]

## Gear

There is a list of required melee and range gear in order to attempt the Colosseum. Aside from your weapon, you can use any of the listed items, as none of them provide further boosts (i.e. using torva over bandos doesnt give you any extra completion chance). Just as long as you have them equipped in their respective setups.

### Melee

If you have 300+ charges in your Scythe, you will receive a 10% boost. You can only have 1 amulet equipped. Therefore, you will only receive either the 5% boost from the Torture, or the -5% death chance from the Blood Fury (requires 900 charges).
