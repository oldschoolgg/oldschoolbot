title: "The Nightmare"
---

You can kill The Nightmare to receive the inquisitor's armour set, the [[inquisitor's mace]], the [[nightmare staff]], and the 3 orbs that can be combined with the nightmare staff: [[harmonised orb]], [[eldritch orb]], and [[volatile orb]]. Phosani's nightmare is also available to kill, see below.

While killing The Nightmare, your minion has a chance to die. This chance is affected by your kc and gear. Your chance of death has a maximum of 90%, and a minimum of 2%.

### Type of Trip

You are able to send solo mass nightmare trips. The other party members are basically clones of your minion, so your boosts and penalties are mimicked to them. This also means that not all uniques will be in your name, as other members have the same chance at unique drops.

To start a solo Nightmare trip, use [[/k name\: Solo nightmare]].

To start a mass Nightmare trip, use [[/k name\: Mass nightmare]].

### Boosts and Penalties

There are certain boosts and penalties given based on specific stats and gear. They are as follows:

#### Total KC

0-9 - 15% speed penalty - In masses, having less than 10kc gives a 20% damage reduction.

10-24 - 5% speed penalty

25-49 - 2% speed penalty

50-99 - 2% speed increase

100+ - 4% speed increase

#### Crush Attack Stat

Less than 65 crush attack - 5% speed penalty

Essentially, any weapon weaker than a [[Zamorakian hasta]] will incur this penalty.

In masses, your damage output will be halved if you have lower than 65 crush attack.

In masses, your damage output will be doubled if using an [[inquisitor's mace]].

#### Melee Strength Bonus

Less than 40% of maximum strength bonus (<82) - 6% speed penalty

Between 40-49% of maximum strength bonus (83-102) - 3% speed penalty

Between 50-59% of maximum strength bonus (103-123) - 2% speed penalty

The maximum melee strength bonus is 204. Anything above 123 will not incur these penalties.

#### Inquisitor Items Equipped

 
**Solos:** 2% boost per piece (10% boost if all 4 items are equipped)

 **Masses:** 0.5% boost per piece (3% boost if all 4 items are equipped)

Having an [[Elysian spirit shield]] equipped in your melee setup will also reduce food usage by 17.5%. However, this is outweighed by the food reduction of using an [[Elder maul]] or a [[Dragon defender]].

## Phosani's Nightmare

Phosani's Nightmare is a more difficult, solo-only version of The Nightmare of Ashihama. It drops the same items as the normal Nightmare, as well as the [[Parasitic egg]] and the [[Slepey tablet]].
While unique items are rarer from Phosani's Nightmare than they are from the regular Nightmare, Phosani's Nightmare can be killed significantly faster, capping out at 2kc per trip (4kc if patreon).

To kill Phosani's Nightmare, use [[/k name\: Phosani's Nightmare]].

### Requirements

Phosani's Nightmare requires at least 50kc at normal Nightmare.

#### Stats

Level 90 Attack/Strength/Defence/Magic/Hitpoints

Level 70 Prayer

A Defence Slash stat of at least 150

An Attack Crush stat of at least 80

#### Items (per kill)

700 [[Fire rune]]

490 [[Air rune]]

70 [[Wrath rune]]

1 [[Super restore(4)]]

1 [[Sanfew serum(4)]]

1 [[Super combat potion(4)]] - Only uses 2-doses per kill

### Boosts

For the staff boost, you can only have 1. The bot will check for an equipped [[Tumeken's shadow]] first, followed by an equipped [[Sanguinesti staff]], and if neither of those are met, the bank is checked for a [[Harmonised nightmare staff]].

6% for [[Tumeken's shadow]] (must be equipped and charged in mage setup, uses 70 charges per kill)

3% for [[Sanguinesti staff]] (must be equipped and charged in mage setup, uses 85 charges per kill)

3% for [[Harmonised nightmare staff]] (works from bank)

3% for [[Elder maul]] (works from bank)

3% for [[Dragon claws]] (works from bank)

Up to 13.2% for equipped melee gear (see below)

15% for [[Slepey tablet]] (guaranteed at 100KC)

You must use the tablet for the boost to apply: [[/use item\: Slepey tablet]]

### BiS Gear

Your melee gear will provide a boost up to 13.2%. This boost is based on each piece of BiS gear you have equipped, with each piece giving 1.2%. Equipping anything that is not BiS, will not grant the 1.2% boost for that slot. [[Rada's Blessing 4]] is BiS for the ammo slot, all other blessings will not suffice.
