You can complete almost all the same combat achievements in the bot, as the real game. However, the method in order to obtain some achievements are different to the real game as the bot simply cannot reflect the nature of the all tasks.

Some tasks (usually kc-based tasks) are claimed retroactively by using: [[/ca claim]]

To view all your complete and incomplete CA tasks, or filter by monster, use:

[[/ca view type\:all]]
[[/ca view type\:complete]]
[[/ca view name\:Barrows type\:incomplete]]

## Rewards

Rewards can be claimed by using [[/ca claim]] after completing a new tier. You can use the same command to view how close you are to the next tier.
