Item contracts work similarly to Farming contracts. The bot will ask you for a random item, and you hand it in for a reward. You can receive GP, clue scrolls, XP lamps, and dragon or rune items as rewards. There is an 8-hour cooldown for handing in item contracts.

You can get your first item contract, or check your current contract, using: [[/ic info]]

## How it works

- You can be assigned any item that's dropped by TMBs or UMBs.
- You build up a streak by not skipping contracts. At certain streak milestones (10th, 25th, 50th, 100th), you'll receive a bonus reward proportional to the streak length. It pays to not skip!
- Item contracts can be skipped with [[/ic skip]], but this will reset your streak and apply a 4-hour cooldown.
- You can buy the assigned item from other players; you donâ€™t have to obtain it yourself.
