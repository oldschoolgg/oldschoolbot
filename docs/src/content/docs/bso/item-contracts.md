Item contracts work similar to Farming contracts, the bot will ask you for a random item, and you hand it in for a reward. You get GP, clue scrolls, XP Lamps, dragon and rune items as rewards. There is an 8 hour cooldown for handing in item contracts.

You can get your first item contract, or check your current contract, using: [[/ic info]]

## How it works

- You can be assigned any item that's dropped by TMB's or UMB's
- You build up a streak if you don't skip any contracts, reaching certain divisible milestones in your streak grants you an extra reward. Every 10th, 25th, 50th, 100th contract gets you a bonus reward, proportional to the size of the streak. It pays to not skip!
- Item contracts can be skipped with `/ic skip`, however this will reset your streak and incur a 4 hour cooldown.
- You can buy the assigned item off other players, you don't have to obtain it yourself.
