# Moktang

Moktang is a mining-skilling boss, made of rocks and lava. The boss is _created_ by you, by using a spell on rocks. You create 'Moktang totems' using rocky/magic materials and elder runes, and then you use the totems to summon the boss and fight it.

Moktang drops the Igne gear frame, which is used in creating the [Igne Claws](../../custom-items/tames/igne-equipment.md#igne-claw-creation) and [Igne Armour](../../custom-items/tames/igne-equipment.md#igne-armor-creation) to improve your Igne tame. It also drops an item used to create volcanic pickaxes, the highest tier pickaxes.
