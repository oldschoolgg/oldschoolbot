For this fight you will also need [Enhanced Potions](../../skills/herblore.md#custom-content-and-boosts).

## Getting Started

To fight the boss, use `/k` name: `naxxus`

## Boosts

- Void Staff - 10%
- Abyssal Tome - 7.5%
- Tzkal Cape - 5%
- Vasa Cloak - 5%
- Ignis Ring (i) - 2.5%
- Spellbound Ring/(i) - 2%/2.5%

## Loot

The unique drops from Naxxus are untradeable (all four items listed below). There is a special mechanic with Naxxus where you won't get a duplicate unique until you have all of them at least once. The chance to roll the unique table is 1/150, the Abyssal Gem and Spellbound ring are more likely to drop first.

- **Dark Crystal:** Used to `/create` the Void Staff (u), a chargeable BiS magic weapon that provides boosts to Cox, Vasa, Sea Kraken, and Naxxus
- **Tattered Tome:** Used to `/create` the Abyssal Tome, a BiS magic tome that boosts Naxxus
- **Spellbound Ring:** BiS magic ring that boosts Naxxus, it can be imbued with a Magus Scroll to further increase the stats
- **Abyssal Gem:** Used to invent the [Abyssal Amulet](../../skills/invention/#inventions)
