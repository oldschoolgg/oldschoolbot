## Nex

Nex is an endgame boss that requires [[prayer:95]] and a Frozen Key to start. You can either solo or mass it, and it requires high-level ranged gear to fight. Its unique drops include Pernix, Torva, and Virtus gear. Nex also drops a decent amount of TMBs and Grandmaster clues.

## Gear Recommendations

_The Abyssal Cape is highly recommended to start with, as it significantly reduces your chance of death._

To fight Nex, aim for a gear setup with 205+ ranged attack and as high ranged defence as possible to reduce the cost of Saradomin brews and super restores. Equipping a Barbarian Assault arrow (from untradeable mystery boxes) in your ammo slot helps greatly with ranged attack bonus, allowing for tankier gear. You will receive a speed penalty if your ranged attack bonus is under 200.

### Max Range Setup

- Full Gorajan Archer
- Farsight Snapshot Necklace
- Venator Ring
- Hellfire Bow / Zaryte Bow
- Abyssal Cape / Combatants Cape
- Arrow slot makes no difference in max range setup
- Each kill takes 8 minutes (480.28 seconds, rounded down)

### Ironman Setup

**Warning:** You will likely die repeatedly with this setup. It's recommended for ironmen to gain KC in masses first.

## Boosts

_All boosts are divided by team size._

- Full Pernix – 20% (2.4% per individual piece)
- Full Gorajan Archer – 15%
- Zaryte Bow – 20%

## Loot

Nex drops broken armour pieces that must be repaired using components from God Wars sets. The Torva set is made by using [[/create item\:revert]] on Bandos pieces, then [[/create item\:[piece name]]]. Pernix and Virtus use the same process, with Armadyl and Ancestral components respectively.

- **Ancient emblem** – No current use
- **Bloodsoaked feather** – Used to create the Nex pet, [[Nexterminator]]
- **Ancient hilt** – Used to create the Ancient Godsword
- **Nex armour** – Torva, Pernix, and Virtus armour sets; can be upgraded to best-in-slot [Gorajan armour](/bso/skills/dungeoneering/#gorajan-armour)
  - Drop rate for hitting the gear table scales with team size; any specific item is ~1/1600
- **Nex weapons** – Dropped from the same table as Nex armour
  - **Zaryte Bow** – Boosts Nex performance and used to create the Hellfire Bow
  - **Virtus Crystal** – Combine with Mage’s Book or Kodai Wand to create Virtus Book or Virtus Wand
