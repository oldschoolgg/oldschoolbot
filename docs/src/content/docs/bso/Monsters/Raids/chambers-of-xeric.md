## Supplies

**Stamina potion(4) - Solo = 2, Mass = 1**

**Saradomin brew(4) - At 0 KC 7, scaling to 1** with higher kc.

**Super restore(4) - At 2 Kc 2, scaling to 1** with higher kc. (1/3 of brews needed rounded down)

Saradomin brew calculation :\
Max(1, 8 - Max(1, Ceiling((KC+1)/30)))\
Where Max means the highest number - this just ensures you always need at least 1\
Ceiling is rounding up to the nearest whole number, i.e. 5.78 = 6, 2.01 = 3\
Examples:\
50 KC: 8-ceiling(50+1)/30) = 8-ceiling(1.7) = 8-2 = 6\
500 KC: 8-ceiling(500+1)/30) = max(1, 8-(ceiling(16.7)) = max(1,-9) = 1
