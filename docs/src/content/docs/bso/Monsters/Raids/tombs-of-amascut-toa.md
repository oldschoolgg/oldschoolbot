### Melee

### Range

Note: You need to equip enough arrows to use (150 per raid, usage is reduced by Ava's effect). If using a Hellfire bow you need to use Hellfire arrows, Twisted bow can use Adamant, Rune, Amethyst, Dragon or Hellfire arrows, Bow of Faedhinen (c) does not require arrows

### Mage
