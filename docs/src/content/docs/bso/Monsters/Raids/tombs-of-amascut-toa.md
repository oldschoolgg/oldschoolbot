## Boosts

Boosts and best-in-slot gear differ between BSO and OSB. With higher kc, your death chance will reduce and your speed boost will increase. The maximum death chance reduction is received at 250+ **attempts** (not KC) and the maximum speed boost will be received at 350+ **attempts** (not KC).

### Gear Score

Gear score affects both death chance and speed boost:

- Max speed boost from gear score: +15%
- If **any** gear setup (melee, range, or mage) is below 90%, you receive a **+10% death-chance penalty**
- Full speed boost is reached at **93.1%** gear score (due to rounding). A gear score above 93.1% (e.g. 100%) adds no further benefit in any way.
- Gorajan sets grant **no special bonus** over Torva/Pernix/Virtus. Only the stats matter.
- Blowpipe dart type grants **no bonus in any way**; use Adamant or Rune darts to save costs

### Speed-Boost Items

Unless noted, these work from your bank:

- Bandos Godsword (+2%)
- Zaryte Crossbow (+9%) **OR** Dragon Claws (+6%)
- Osmumten’s Fang (+15%) **OR** Ghrazi Rapier (+6%)
- Void Staff — **special 50%** time reduction (must be equipped in mage setup)
- Hellfire Bow (+4%) (must be equipped in range setup)
- Chincannon — **special 60%** time reduction, but **destroys all loot for teammates** (must be equipped in range)

### Notes on Speed Boosts

- Osmumten’s Fang is BiS at invocation 300+. Below 300, the order is reversed, and Ghrazi Rapier becomes BiS at +15%.
- Due to the way boosts are calculated, Void Staff and Chincannon boosts are significantly stronger than all other boosts. Void Staff’s effective boost is >8x all other boosts combined (excluding Chincannon).
- In teams of 3+, the **slowest player’s boost is ignored** (see Team Size Boosts section).

## Team Size Boosts

| Party Size | Speed Boost (%) |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
| 1 (Solo)   | 0%              |
| 2          | 10%             |
| 3          | 15%             |
| 4          | 20%             |
| 5 – 8      | 25%             |

> In parties of 3+, the player with the lowest boost is ignored. This is to encourage carrying new players, which allows the team to obtain a higher over team size speed boost, without suffering from the new players' lack of attempts/kc.

## Consumable supply requirements (darts, arrows, potions)

* ~150 darts + 150 scales from blowpipe (reduced by Ava’s device)
* ~150 arrows (if not using a zero-arrow weapon; reduced by Ava’s device)
	* Hellfire Bow: must use Hellfire Arrows  
	* Twisted Bow: must use Adamant arrows or better (the type of arrow has a small impact on gear score)
	* Bow of Faerdhinen (c): no arrows consumed. Use Barbarian Assault arrows for BiS stats
	* Chincannon: consumes Explosive material and consumes arrows (the type of arrow has a small impact on gear score)
* 1× Sanfew Serum (or Serpentine Helm equipped in Melee with 600 charges/hr)
* 1× Ranging Potion
* 1× Super Combat Potion
* Super restores and Saradomin brews, based on your KC according to the table below

| KC Range | Brews Needed | Restores Needed |
|:--------:|:------------:|:---------------:|
| < 2      | 8            | 5               |
| 2 – 4    | 8            | 4               |
| 5 – 50   | 5 – 8        | 2               |
| ≥ 96     | 1            | 2               |

## Max Gear Setups

> Gear scores of at least 93.1% deliver the same boosts as 100%. Below are “100% reference” setups. There is no benefit to exceeding the max.

#### Melee (100%)

- Full Gorajan Warrior (or Torva)
- Brawler’s Hook Necklace
- TzKal Cape
- Osmumten’s Fang (Ghrazi Rapier if invocation 1-299)
- Avernic Defender or equivalent
- Ignis Ring (i)

> Offhand Spidergore weapons provide less defenses than Avernic Defender, and therefore are **NOT** recommended.
> A Osmumten’s Fang (or) **WILL NOT** receive the +15% boost, and is therefore **NOT** recommended. Note that you **CANNOT** revert it at this time.

#### Range (100%)

- Full Gorajan Archer (or Pernix)
- Farsight Snapshot Necklace
- Ava’s Assembler or equivalent
- Hellfire Bow + Hellfire Arrows
- Ring of Piercing (i)

> Tidal Collector (i) is superior and therefore recommended, but not always required for 100%.
> Master Range/Combatant’s Cape offers more defense, but less offense than Ava's Assembler, and therefore will likely reduce your gear score

#### Mage (100%)

- Full Gorajan Occult (or Virtus)
- Arcane Blast Necklace
- Imbued Saradomin Cape
- Void Staff
- Abyssal Tome
- (no ring)

> Vasa Cloak is superior, and therefore recommended, but not always required for 100%.
> A ring is recommended, but not always required for 100%.

### Strategy

* Since a gear score of 93.1% or higher grants full boost, you may wish to sacrifice a small amount of gear score to save on costs:
  * Melee: Equip Serpentine Helm (600 charges/hr) instead of a Sanfew Serum.
  * Range: Use Bow of Faerdhinen (c) + Barbarian Assault arrow to avoid arrow consumption (at max gear score/stats, you will be missing out on approximately 0.25% overall boost from not using a Hellfire Bow).
  * Since darts don't affect death chance or speed boost, you are recommended to use adamant darts or rune darts to save on cost. There is no benefit to using dragon darts.
* Theoretically, assuming max gear and 350+ attempts, 450 invocations should give the highest rate of uniques per hour.
* At early attempts/kc, you are recommended to mass in chincannons at level 150 invocation, so that you can make progression towards the total 2000 normal/expert KC Icthlarin's shroud (tier 5).
