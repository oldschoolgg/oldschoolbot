Depths of Alantis is an underwater raid, where you escort travellers from the surface, to the underwater city of Atlantis, battling dangerous monsters on the way. You have a chance to get some rare drops from the monsters you face on the way, and also a generous payment once you arrive at Atlantis

## Quick Start

- Do `/raid doa help` to see if you're ready to do DOA, and to see what requirements you are missing. It will also show your kc, attempts, and other things.
- Do `/raid doa start` to start a raid.
- Start off by raiding with others in teams of 2-5, preferably. But you can solo at any time.

- Good melee gear in your melee setup. A Piercing trident, or Atlantean trident, are **required.**

## Rewards & Uniques

For each DOA raid, your team has a 1 in X chance of receiving a unique, which then goes to a random person in the team. Then, the recipient receives a unique that they haven't yet received, or if they have received them all, they receive a random one.

If you didn't get a unique, you instead roll on the non-unique table, which gives... Oceanic dye, Shark tooth, Clues and Supplies(Gems, Ores, Stone spirits, Fletching items, Rune items, Dragon items).

Lastly, there is the pet droprate, that everyone gets a roll of every raid, the droprate is shown in `/droprate`

### Uniques

These uniques are dropped at the 1 in X droprate mentioned above.
