# Depths of Atlantis (DoA)

Depths of Alantis is an underwater raid, where you escort travellers from the surface, to the underwater city of Atlantis, battling dangerous monsters on the way. You have a chance to get some rare drops from the monsters you face on the way, and also a generous payment once you arrive at Atlantis

## Quick Start

- Do `/raid doa help` to see if you're ready to do DOA, and to see what requirements you are missing. It will also show your kc, attempts, and other things.
- Do `/raid doa start` to start a raid.
- Start off by raiding with others in teams of 2-5, preferably. But you can solo at any time.

## Requirements

Use `/raid doa help` to see which requirements you don't have!

- Good melee gear in your melee setup. A Piercing trident, or Atlantean trident, are **required.**

### Food/Item Costs per raid

## Rewards & Uniques

For each DOA raid, your team has a 1 in X chance of receiving a unique, which then goes to a random person in the team. Then, the recipient receives a unique that they haven't yet received, or if they have received them all, they receive a random one.

If you didn't get a unique, you instead roll on the non-unique table, which gives... Oceanic dye, Shark tooth, Clues and Supplies(Gems, Ores, Stone spirits, Fletching items, Rune items, Dragon items).

Lastly, there is the pet droprate, that everyone gets a roll of every raid, the droprate is shown in `/droprate`

### Uniques

These uniques are dropped at the 1 in X droprate mentioned above.
