## Rewards & Uniques

Each raid gives your team a 1 in X chance to receive a unique item, which goes to a random eligible player who hasn’t received it yet (if possible). Otherwise, a random unique is given.

If no unique is awarded, you roll on the non-unique table: Oceanic Dye, Shark Tooth, Clues, and Supplies (Gems, Ores, Stone Spirits, Fletching Items, Rune/Dragon items).

Each player gets a pet roll per raid (view drop rate via [[/droprate]]).
