### [[gc]]

- Made improvements to giveaways, so that huge giveaways dont cause problems anymore.
- Added aliases for supply crates and their keys. An alias is an alternate name, e.g. how you can use "tmb" instead of writing "Tradeables mystery box". You can now write "s1" for a s1 crate, and "s1 key" for the key (and so on for the others).
- Added christmas cracker to christmas cracker cl
- Removed blood oranges from zygomite mutations
- Renamed zombie/vampyric hween masks to "halloween" instead of "hween"
- Added black swan to dc misc CL
- Improved IC donation message, so the person sees their next IC.
- Removed some duplicate collection logs that were mistakenly there.

### [[gc]]

- Added a new [[Frozen crate (s8)]] key crate, which replaces the spooky crate.
- Added the Christmas Event! Here are the instructions and information:

  First, chop 8 [[Snowdream logs]], and create a [[Snowdream staff]] from them. Then, runecraft some [[Snowdream rune]] runes. Equip the staff anywhere, and your minion will automatically begin using the runes passively on trips, and give you chances at getting the reward items. When you run out of runes, you will need to buy/runecraft more. If you want to get a faster/higher chance of receiving reward items, you can do the "active" version, of actively casting the spell (on a minion trip keeping your minion busy), which will grant you 2.5x higher droprates than the passive version.

  - Check your info with [[/christmas check]]
  - To do the 'active casting', use [[/christmas active_cast]]. Note that you can pick your trip length of 1, 2 or 3 hours for this.
  - View the droprates with [[/christmas drop_rates]]
  - Your minion is casting a spell to help children fall asleep on christmas eve, or something like that.
  - The event is planned to go on for roughly 10 days.
  - Irons are given a snowflake amulet which gives 3x more snowdream runes.
  - Non-irons can make 75 snowdream runes per minute, 4500/hr. You use 30 snowdream runes per minute.

  These are all the available rewards from the event:

  [[Snowdream robe legs]] [[Snowdream wizard hat]] [[Snowdream robe top]] [[Snowdream wizard socks]] [[Black santa top]] [[Black santa legs]] [[Black santa gloves]] [[Black santa boots]] [[Snowdream rune]] [[Snowdream pillow]] [[Chef-touched heart (choc)]] [[Sungod slippers]] [[Icey santa hat]] [[Grinchling]] [[Shrimpy]] [[Snowflake amulet]] [[Snowdream staff]]

## 29/10/2024

### [[gc]]

- The halloween pet crate boost was incorrectly coded as 5x instead of 10x, this is now fixed so its 10x. You can roughly expect a crate every hour if using one (or more if you're an iron).
- If you get the 10x hween pet boost, you now get a message saying that.

### [[nwjgit]]

- Made changes to skillcapes, so that higher-level capes always receive the perks of lower-level ones. E.g. Comp cape gives all master/skill-cape perks, expert capes gives all the master/skill-cape perks, etc.
- OSB Changes: Finished Wyrm agility and cox trip repeating.

## 28/10/2024

### [[gc]]

- You now have 10x higher crate droprates if you have any halloween pet equipped, they are: Kuro, Gregoyle, Mumpkin, Mumpkin (demonic), Mumpkin (pumpkin), Mumpkin (dead), Polterpup, Mini pumpkinhead, Mini mortimer, Casper, Cob.
- Ironmen previously had a 3x bonus crate droprate, this has been increased to 6x.
- The 2 new halloween pets have been added to the DC pets CL.
- The new items have been desecretted, so they no longer are hidden from places, and the collection logs show.
- You can now buy pumpkin seeds.

### Turbo

- Korulsi herbs can now be cleaned on harvest, like other herbs

## 26/10/2024

### [[gc]]

- A new crate, the **Sinister crate (s7)** has been added! It drops **12** unique items, 1 of which is a mega-rare. You can get the crates passively from doing any trip, or buying them on the G.E. You can buy keys for 20m GP to open them. The previous crate is now discontinued.

### [[themrrobert]]

> 🎃 **Halloween Side-Event**
>
> Cyr has coded an event for halloween! Note that this is not the main halloween event, which is coming.
>
> To start, any trip, regardless of duration, has a 1/3 chance to trigger the event. Once you get the event start messeage (Pumpkinhead chatbox), you are given a Spookling token.
>
> When completing trips, for every minute, there is a 1 in 12 chance to get a 'trick or treat' point. If you get at least one point, there is a 55% chance of getting a trick, otherwise it's a 'treat.' Trick vs treat doesn't affect pet chance, but only treats can also give you Halloween candy. Themed > messsages differ between tricks and treats, and there are a few different messages for being lucky enough to get the pet also.
>
> Pet drop rate is 1 per 80 trick or treat points (~20 hours) Each pet on CL makes the next one 5x rarer. You also get 1 Spookling token for each trick or treat point. (1 in 12 per minute, or ~5 per hour on average).
>
> You can "cash in" the Spookling tokens by going to /k Pumpkinhead to claim his head, in the form of a Miniature pumpkin head. The cost is 100 Spookling tokens, with a max of 3 heads purchasable. ~25 > hours per head

- Ironmen can now donate item contracts
- Fix box spawn replies

# 2/10/2024

We now have a new wiki at https://wiki.oldschool.gg/, and the BSO Wiki is now combined together with the OSB wiki. Many pages are out of date, I'm trying to update pages when I have time. Currently, the only way to contribute to the new wiki is by editing files in [this folder on github](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/tree/master/docs/src/content/docs).

### [[nwjgit]]

- PMBs now automatically have new pets added
- Allow multiple colosseum attempts per trip
- Add boosts for BSO items to colosseum
- Fixed requirements for Music cape(t)
- Make spooky graceful dc and remove it from the graceful cl
- Remove [[Partyhat set]] & [[Partyhat & specs]] from the creatables CL to the christmas cracker CL
- Updated muspah gear for bso, adding a boost for void staff, hellfire bow, gorajan, etc.
- Fixed the [[Tidal collector (i)]], which now requires 5x Blessed dizana's quiver to create.
