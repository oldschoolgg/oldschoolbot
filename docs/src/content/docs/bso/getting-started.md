This guide assumes you have bought a minion ([[/minion buy]]) and have read the [OSB Starter Guide](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/getting-started/beginner-guide). Once you have mid-level equipment (Barrow's or Godwars equipment) and a few mid to high level stats (80s+), then you are done with the early game prep for BSO.

Most of the content within BSO takes place in the endgame, with a few exceptions such as [QBD](/bosses/demi-bosses/queen-black-dragon), [Dungeoneering](skills/dungeoneering-training/), and some [custom pets](custom-items/pets.md). To build up early money aside from what you earn levelling skills, it is advised to frequently redeem your `/minion daily`, as well as opening or selling any mystery boxes you may receive for extra money. You can also earn decent money while training combat stats by levelling your [Slayer](/skills/slayer) skill. Much of the content before doing end game content (which consists mainly of custom bosses) is levelling stats and gathering money to purchase better gear from other players.

Once you have a decent amount of money, you can kill demi-bosses as a method of earning a decent amount of cash from unique drops and [Grandmaster Clues](/custom-items/grandmaster-clues). These demi-bosses consist of, in order from lowest requirements to highest: [Queen Black Dragon](/bosses/demi-bosses/queen-black-dragon), [Sea Kraken](/bosses/demi-bosses/sea-kraken), [Treebeard](/bosses/demi-bosses/treebeard), [Malygos](/bosses/demi-bosses/malygos), [Nihiliz](bso-custom-killables/demi-bosses/nihiliz.md)

These bosses are better fought with higher tier equipment, so read the following:
It is advised that after you have killed the demi-bosses enough to afford better gear to focus on killing [Kalphite King](/bosses/kalphite-king) and [Nex](/bosses/nex) for the best weapons and armour, respectively. Having these gear pieces unlocks the current end stage of the game, consisting of bosses with high requirements and high rewards. [Vasa Magus](/bosses/vasa-magus), [King Goldemar](/bosses/king-goldemar), [Ignecarus](/bosses/ignecarus), and [Emerged Zuk](minigames/emerged-zuk-inferno.md) are all late-game bosses that reward BIS gear items for different activities.
As far as content goes, the above is the current endgame for PvM. However, there are various skilling activities and minigames not listed in this guide that are easily accessed on other wiki pages. If you wish to be more involved with BSO then it is highly recommended that you read up on a few, if not most, of the wiki pages in order to have a better grasp on everything available within the bot.

All xp in BSO is granted a 5x boost from OSB/OSRS rates.

## Global Boosts

There are five extremely rare items called [First Age](../custom-items/equippables/#first-age) that each boost all xp gains by 1% with an additional 1% added if you have all 5 equipped.

Having a [master cape](../custom-items/equippables/#master-capes) equipped anywhere will give a global 3% boost to all xp gained. This goes up to 8% when training the skill you have mastery in.

A community spreadsheet, available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZMaCkbzR2TV9QVoRub74btXCc8Cw1coVff7VXUxvYkE/htmlview), shows all the best exp rates of each skill. You are also able to enter your own exp and see the time left to reach various xp milestones.`

## Max Trip Length

There are many ways to increase your minion's max trip length in BSO. The default time is 30 minutes. This can be increased with [patreon](../custom-items/patronage.md) by 3 minutes at tier 1, 6 minutes at tier 2, and 10 minutes at tier 3+. You can gain 15 seconds for every 2.5b value (including Skipper bonus) you have sacrificied up to a maximum of +1 minute at 10b. This is multiplied 3x with tier 3+ patron for +3 minutes at 10b. The [Hitpoints Master Cape](../custom-items/equippables/#master-capes) increases your max trip length for all things /k by 20% as well as dungeoneering trips by 10% along with an additional +6.18 minutes gained from having level 120 hp. Zak will extended your max trip by 40% (these 20% and 40% boosts are not applied to the time from sac value nor from leagues). Finally for having 50k+ league points you will gain an additional +1 minute to your max trip length.The maximum current trip length is therefore `(30+10+(110/89*5))*1.2*1.4+3+1` = 81.582 minutes
