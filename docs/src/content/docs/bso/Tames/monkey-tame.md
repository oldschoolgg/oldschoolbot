Congratulations! You have beaten enough monkeys to be rewarded with your very own chimp! Your monkey can run around and gather supplies for you while you monkey around elsewhere.

## Hatching the Tame

There are no specific requirements to hatch the monkey tame. See [Tames](/bso/tames/introduction/#hatching-the-tame) for more information on hatching it.

On hatching, there is a 1/60 chance that it could be a shiny monkey, which is increased to 1/58 with a Ring of luck equipped or in the bank.

## Growth

Upon getting a Monkey Egg, you can put it in your nursery and hatch it. It will take 4.5 hours to hatch. Once hatched, it will grow over time from a baby → juvenile → adult.

In order for the tame to grow, you have to send it out on collecting trips. Like the '/collect blue dragon scale' command, you can send your monkey tame off to collect items.

A baby monkey is equivalent to the collecting speed of a minion. An adult monkey can get over 3× faster with the two fed item boosts.

For more information on tame commands see [Tames](/bso/tames/introduction/)

## Staff & Spells

You can equip your monkey tame with a staff so it can do magic. Acquire a T1 staff then upgrade it to higher tiers using [[/create item\:Seamonkey staff (t1)]]

### Seamonkey Staff Creation

| Staff Tier | Speed Boost | Cost                                      | magic level   |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| T1         | 5%          | 1× Polypore staff                         | [[magic:95]]  |
| T2         | 8%          | 1× Oceanic relic, 1× Seamonkey staff (t1) | [[magic:105]] |
| T3         | 14%         | 1× Aquifer aegis, 1× Seamonkey staff (t2) | [[magic:115]] |

A tier 2 staff is needed to cast any spell currently. The tier 3 staff boosts your cast time by 12%.

Feeding your monkey a Klik boosts your Tan Leather cast time by a further 22%.
