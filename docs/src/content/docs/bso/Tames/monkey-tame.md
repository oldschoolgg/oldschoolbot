Congratulations! You have beat enough monkeys to be rewarded with your very own chimp!\
Your ape can run around and gather supplies for you while you monkey around elsewhere.

## Hatching the Tame

There are no specific requirements to hatch the monkey tame. See [Tames](./#hatching-the-tame) for more information on hatching it.

On hatching, there is a 1/60 chance that it could be a shiny monkey, which is increased by 3% (to 1/58) with a Ring of luck equipped or in the bank.

## Growth

Upon getting a Monkey Egg, you can put it in your nursery and hatch it. It will take 4.5 hours to hatch. Once hatched it will grow over time from a baby -> juvenile -> adult.

In order for the tame to grow you have to send it out on collecting trips\
Like the `/collect` command, you can send your monkey tame off to go collect items. e.g. `/tames collect blue dragon scale`

A baby monkey is equivalent to the collecting speed of a minion, an adult monkey can get over 3x faster, with the 2 fed item boosts!

For more information on tame commands see [Tames](./)
