title: "Monkey Tame"
---

Congratulations! You have beat enough monkeys to be rewarded with your very own chimp! Your monkey can run around and gather supplies for you while you monkey around elsewhere.

## Hatching the Tame

There are no specific requirements to hatch the monkey tame. See [Tames](./#hatching-the-tame) for more information on hatching it.

On hatching, there is a 1/60 chance that it could be a shiny monkey, which is increased by 3% (to 1/58) with a Ring of luck equipped or in the bank.

## Growth

Upon getting a Monkey Egg, you can put it in your nursery and hatch it. It will take 4.5 hours to hatch. Once hatched it will grow over time from a baby -> juvenile -> adult.

In order for the tame to grow you have to send it out on collecting trips\
Like the `/collect` command, you can send your monkey tame off to go collect items. e.g. `/tames collect blue dragon scale`

A baby monkey is equivalent to the collecting speed of a minion, an adult monkey can get over 3x faster, with the 2 fed item boosts!

For more information on tame commands see [Tames](./)

## Staff & Spells

You can equip your monkey tame with a staff so it can do magic. Acquire a t1 staff then upgrade it to higher tiers using the create command `/create item:Seamonkey staff (t1)`

### Seamonkey staff Creation

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th align="center">Staff Tier</th><th align="center">Speed Boost</th><th align="center">Cost</th><th align="center">Magic level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">T1</td><td align="center">5%</td><td align="center">1x Polypore staff</td><td align="center">95</td></tr><tr><td align="center">T2</td><td align="center">8%</td><td align="center">1x Oceanic relic, 1x Seamonkey staff (t1)</td><td align="center">105</td></tr><tr><td align="center">T3</td><td align="center">14%</td><td align="center">1x Aquifer aegis, 1x Seamonkey staff (t2)</td><td align="center">115</td></tr></tbody></table>

A tier 2 staff is needed to cast any spell currently. The tier 3 staff boosts your cast time by 12%

Feeding your monkey a Klik boosts your Tan leather cast time by a further 22%
