title: "Eagle Tame"
---

The eagle tame focuses on clue scrolls. After incubating an [[Eagle egg]] for 4.5 hours it hatches and grows just like the other tames.

## Boosts

You can feed the eagle tame certain items with [[/tames feed item\:[item]]]<br />
**Note:** Feeding any other items (food included) will have no effect.<br />

Send your eagle on clue trips with [[/tames collect clue_tier:master]]. It completes clues by itself and benefits from the items above.

## Mechanics and requirements

- Only Eagle tames can do clue trips.
- Time per clue starts at clue base time * 1.15, then reduced by support level scaling.
- [[Divine ring]] gives a speed bonus on Eagle clue trips.
- Cost per clue trip: clue scrolls + extraordinary kibble (scaled by tier and quantity).
- For Grandmaster/Elder clues, all STASH units must be built and full.
- Elder clueing requires feeding [[Elder knowledge]].
