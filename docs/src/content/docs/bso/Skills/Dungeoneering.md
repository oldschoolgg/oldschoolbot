title: "Dungeoneering"
---

## Starting Out

There are 7 floors. Each floor requires +20 Dungeoneering levels from the previous and increasingly higher stats in other skills, especially combat.

Start training: [[/dg start]]  
Buy rewards: [[/dg buy item\:]]  
View stats: [[/dg stats]]

From Floor 5+, you can get tradeable **Gorajan shards**. Combine 2 shards with a Nex armour piece to make **Gorajan armour** using smithing.

In Floor 7, there's a 1/20,000 per-minute chance to get a **Gorajan bonecrusher (u)**.  
(Trip length = roll count, e.g. 64 rolls for 1h 4m trip.)

You receive Dungeoneering tokens at a rate of: **XP ÷ 40**
