# General Information

All xp in BSO is granted a 5x boost from OSB/OSRS rates.

### Global Boosts

There are five extremely rare items called [First Age](../custom-items/equippables/#first-age) that each boost all xp gains by 1% with an additional 1% added if you have all 5 equipped.

Having a [master cape](../custom-items/equippables/#master-capes) equipped anywhere will give a global 3% boost to all xp gained. This goes up to 8% when training the skill you have mastery in.

A community spreadsheet, available [`here`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZMaCkbzR2TV9QVoRub74btXCc8Cw1coVff7VXUxvYkE/htmlview)`, shows all the best exp rates of each skill. You are also able to enter your own exp and see the time left to reach various xp milestones.`

### Max Trip Length

`There are many ways to increase your minion's max trip length in BSO. The default time is 30 minutes. This can be increased with` [`patreon`](../custom-items/patronage.md) `by 3 minutes at tier 1, 6 minutes at tier 2, and 10 minutes at tier 3+. You can gain 15 seconds for every 2.5b value (including Skipper bonus) you have sacrificied up to a maximum of +1 minute at 10b. This is multiplied 3x with tier 3+ patron for +3 minutes at 10b. The` [`Hitpoints Master Cape`](../custom-items/equippables/#master-capes)`increases your max trip length for all things /k by 20% as well as dungeoneering trips by 10% along with an additional +6.18 minutes gained from having level 120 hp. Zak will extended your max trip by 40% (these 20% and 40% boosts are not applied to the time from sac value nor from leagues). Finally for having 50k+ league points you will gain an additional +1 minute to your max trip length.`` `**`The maximum current trip length is`**` ``therefore (30+10+(110/89*5))*1.2*1.4+3+1 =`` `**`81.582`**` ``minutes`
