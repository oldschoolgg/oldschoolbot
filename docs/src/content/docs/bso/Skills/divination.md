## Memory Harvesting in Divination

### Memory Harvesting Overview

Divination is a skill where you harvest divine energies from memories.  
Memory harvesting is the primary training method and involves capturing memories to convert them into experience (XP) or energy.

### Methods

- **Convert to XP:** Converts memories directly into XP. This is the default method. _Not recommended._
- **Convert to Energy:** Converts memories into energies. This is the main way to gain energies.
- **Convert to XP With Energy:** Consumes energies for higher XP/hr. This is the highest XP/hr method.

### Boosts

- [**Wisp-buster**](../invention/#inventions): Boosts XP/hr by 30%
- [**Divine hand**](../invention/#inventions): Boosts energy by 30% and enables clue scroll drops from memories  
  _Only one of the above inventions can be active at a time._

- **Jar of memories:** Adds +7 minutes to max trip length when equipped
- **Boons:** Boosts XP by 10% if the appropriate boon is unlocked
- **Guthixian Cache Boost:** +20% XP and energy for one trip per boost
- **Divination potion:** Grants extra energy/XP and +10 level boost for [[/memoryharvest]]
- **Diviner's outfit:** +4% XP boost
- [**Divination Master Cape**](../../custom-items/equippables/#master-capes)

### Other Notes

- You can receive **Divine eggs** from memory harvesting (except with the "convert with energy" method), which contain random energy and may drop a **Jar of memories**
- You can receive the **Divination pet, Doopy**
- The highest tier energy, **Ancient**, requires unlocking the city of Atlantis via any Depths of Atlantis raid reward

## Boons

Boons are items created with energy to boost XP from specific energy tiers by 10%.  
Energy from one tier is used to make the boon for the next tier.

Steps:

1. Create the boon using [[/create]]
2. Use the boon with [[/use]]
