title: "Slayer Masks / Helms"
---

**To get a slayer mask as a drop, you need to have the slayer reward 'Maskuerade' unlocked.** Some of the monsters need to be unlocked. **You need to be on task** to receive a mask, and to also gain kills towards upgrading into the slayer helm.

Slayer masks are drops from certain slayer monsters. They can then be upgraded into a Slayer helmet by killing the associated monster while owning the mask.

### Requirements

Slayer rewards:

- Maskuerade - 750 points
- Pore Decisions - 600 points
- Basilocked - 80 points
- Need more darkness - 100 points (Not 100% required, but makes it \~5x longer to complete)

### Masks and Rates

The Mask drop rate and kills to upgrade into a slayer helmet are as followed:

| Mask/Helm         | Droprate (1/X) | Kills/upgrade | Monsters                                                     |

### Efficient Slayer Rewards

Basilocked and Pore Decisions need to be unlocked in order to be assigned the monsters. Other rewards can be locked/unlocked in order to increase your chance of getting a mask dropping task.

| Reward                | Unlocked? |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Seeing Red            | false     |
| I hope you mith me    | false     |
| Watch the birdie      | false     |
| Hot Stuff             | false     |
| Reptile got ripped    | false     |
| Like a boss           | false     |
| Basilocked            | false     |
| Actual Vampyre Slayer | false     |
| Pore Decisions        | true      |
| Stop the Wyvern       | true      |

Other rewards can be active in order to increase the task length of mask dropping monsters. This doesn't necessarily make it faster to get all slayer helmets, as some masks take considerably more time. It might make more sense to unlock others to increase Slayer xp/h.

| Monster      | Extension reward                               | Unlocked? |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Aberrant     | Smell ya later                                 | false     |
| Abyssal      | Augment my abbies                              | true      |
| Basilisk     | Basilonger                                     | false     |
| Black demon  | Its Dark In Here                               | false     |
| Bloodveld    | Bleed me dry                                   | true      |
| Dark beast   | Need more darkness                             | true      |
| Dust Devil   | To dust you shall return                       | true      |
| Gargoyle     | Get Smashed                                    | false     |
| 2x all tasks | Size Matters                                   | true      |
| 2x all tasks | **(Dungeoneering scroll)** Scroll of longevity | true      |

### Slayer Masters

#### Slayer XP efficient method

1. Always do task streaks at Konar
2. Complete Ganodermic at Nieve
3. Complete Cockatrice, Crawling hand, Banshee at Mazchna
4. Complete the rest at Konar doing efficient xp/h methods, ensuring you can receive tasks (unlocked and not blocked)

**Slayer helm efficient method**

Mask

Presuming all slayer rewards are set up for efficient mask/slayer helmet hunting, the following is most efficient based on average RNG:

1. Always do Konar for slayer streaks (10th, 50th, 100th, 250th 1000th streak), this gives more slayer points to skip.
2. Use Chaeldar as your default slayer master until you have a Ganodermic Slayer Helm.
3. Mazchna to finish Banshee/Crawling hand/Cocatrice KC
4. Finish anything else at Konar.

This should have you finish all masks. If not, use the below.

<figure><figcaption>Chance of each mask task per "New Task". Efficient unlock/locks assumed. No block list accounted for.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><figcaption>Average task length per "New task". Efficient extensions assumed (Dark beast only).</figcaption></figure>

To make Chaeldar more efficient, you can use the following blocks.

- Cave Kraken
- Iron Dragon
- Spiritual Creature
- Bronze Dragon
- Cave Horror
- Jungle Horror
- Turoth
- Greater Demon
- Hellhound
- Black Demons after helm is complete - replace cave horror, jungle horror, and turoth with these 3
- Trolls after helm is complete
- Gargoyles after helm is complete
