title: "Invention"
---

Invention is a skill where you disassemble items to get materials, and then use those materials to make inventions—items that provide boosts and perks. You need [[crafting:90]] to train Invention.

Access Invention: [[/invention]]  
Invention Minigame: [Tinkering Workshop](../../minigames/tinkering-workshop.md)

## Disassembling

- Disassemble items with [[/invention disassemble]]
- Materials depend on item groups (e.g. food group gives Organic)
- Check group info: [[/invention tools command\:Material Groups]]
- View your materials: [[/invention materials]]
- XP is based on item level and your invention level
- Higher item level = less junk chance

---

## Research

- Use [[/invention research]] with a material to discover blueprints
- Blueprints unlock inventions
- Only needs to be unlocked once

---

## Inventing

- Use [[/invention invent]] to make inventions
- Requires materials and sometimes specific items
- Some work passively from the bank, others must be equipped
- Usage costs small material amounts
- Toggle inventions on/off with [[/config user toggle_invention invention\:name]]
