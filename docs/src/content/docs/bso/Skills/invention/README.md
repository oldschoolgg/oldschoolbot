# Invention

Invention is a skill where you disassemble items to get materials, and then use those materials to make inventions. Inventions are items which give you boosts and perks, at the cost of materials. You need level 90 Crafting to train Invention.

All aspects of the Invention skill are accessed using `/invention`

Invention has a minigame, [Tinkering Workshop](../../minigames/tinkering-workshop.md).

## Disassembling

- Using `/invention disassemble` , select the item you want to disassemble.
- You will disassemble those items into materials. The materials you get are dependent on the _group_ the item is in. For example, items in the _Food_ group will give _Organic_ materials at a 100% ratio. However, some items are obviously more valuable, like a Shark vs a Trout. Check out `/invention tools command:Material Groups for a full list of items you can disassemble.`
- Use `/invention materials` to see what materials you own. Note: They are not tradeable, and cannot be transferred to other players.
- The difference between items (e.g. Shark vs Trout) is their _level_, a Shark has a higher level - and the level determines the _Junk Chance_ of the item, so a Shark is much less likely to become junk. Everything has a chance (high or small) of becoming junk.
- The amount of XP you get from disassembly is dependent on the level of the item and your invention level.

## Research

- Now you have materials!
- Use `/invention research` to research with a particular material type, effectively sending your minion to use this material and try to research and discover things it can make with it.
- If successful, you will discover a _blueprint_ which uses the material that you are researching with. For example, if a particular invention uses _sharp_ materials, and you're researching with _sharp_ materials, you have a chance to unlock the blueprint for it.
- Blueprints only need to be unlocked once, and they grant you the ability to create that invention.

## Inventing

- Now you have materials, and the blueprint for the Invention you want!
- Use `/invention invent` to create the particular invention you want.
- Inventions cost _materials_ to make, and some inventions cost items to make. These are one-time costs.
- Once you have made an invention, if its one that works from the bank, its ready to go! If it's one that needs to be equipped (like Silverhawk boosts), then you'll need to equip them.
- Inventions cost a small amount of _materials_ each time you use them.
- You can use `/config user toggle_invention invention:name` to temporarily toggle a invention off, if you don't want to use it.
- That's it! Your inventions will never break or need to be created again. You cannot trade inventions.

## Tips

- There are bank filters for every material to show all items in your bank which give a particular material. For example, if you want _sharp_ materials, you could do `/bank filter:sharp-material` to see all items you can disassemble to get some
- If your goal is just to train Invention, or to reach level 120, you can just disassemble cheap items! You don't have to disassemble expensive, valuable items.
- There's a collection log for Invention, showing all the Inventions, and the pet it comes with.

## Boosts

- Inventor's Outfit - 4% xp boost to disassemble

### Disassembly Boosts

#### Master capes Disassembly Boosts

Master capes give a 5% junk chance reduction for a group relating to their skill. For example, the Mining master cape reduces the junk chance of the Ores group by 5% - meaning that when you're disassembling items from the Ores group, you'll be getting effectively 5% more materials!
