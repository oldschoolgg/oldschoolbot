# Efficient Disassembling to 99

This guides purpose is to serve as a quick guide to reach level 99 Invention. It is not the absolute fastest way to level 99. Nor is it the most efficient for getting a variety of materials. I recommend you reach level 99/120 first using this guide and then figure out what inventions you want to aim for.

Consider getting the inventor's outfit from [Tinkering Workshop](../../minigames/tinkering-workshop.md) at some point, for 4% bonus XP.
