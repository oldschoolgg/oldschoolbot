title: "Emerged Zuk Inferno"
---

The **Emerged Zuk Inferno** is a new, harder version of the Inferno, where Zuk emerges from the lava, and engages you in a melee fight, and you have to truly kill him in his final form, to win. This is endgame, high-level, costly content, which has heavy requirements, but some very exclusive rewards, which are untradeable.

You can do it using: [[/activities inferno action:Start Inferno Trip emerged:true]]

## Requirements

- All the normal inferno requirements.
- 102 Defence, 102 Magic, 100 Hitpoints, 107 Ranged, and 105 Prayer.
- 20 Normal Inferno KC
- Elder Barrage runes (Elder runes, Blood runes, Death runes)
- Heat res. brews and Heat res. restores; _When Zuk emerges from the lava, lava is splashed and thrown everywhere, which would melt any glass potions, you still need normal brews/restores for before this point though, the heat res is only for the final fight_
- Hellfire bow, Dragon arrows and Hellfire arrows; _You need Dragon arrows for the pre-emerged stage, and Hellfire arrows for the final emerged fight. You equip the Dragon arrows, and keep the Hellfire arrows banked._
- Full Pernix (or full gorajan archer), and a farsight snapshot necklace, in your range outfit
- Full Virtus (or full gorajan occult), and a arcane blast necklace, and a virtus wand, in your mage outfit.
- Full Torva (or full gorajan warrior), minus the helm, and a drygore mainhand + offhand (of any kind), equipped in your melee outfit.
- A blowpipe, loaded with dragon/rune/amethyst darts and scales.

## Boosts

Boosts listed here are specifically for Emerged Zuk attempts. Refer to the [Inferno ](inferno.md#bso-specific-boosts)guide or the [OSB Wiki](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/inferno) for other boosts you think you may be missing. The boosts that apply there will also apply to emerged runs since you have to complete the regular inferno prior to challenging the emerged version of Zuk in each run.

The number of times you have completed the Inferno and the Emerged Inferno will also contribute to the boosts you receive greatly. Due to the math surrounding how these boosts are calculated, they are left out of this page.

It is currently impossible to complete the Emerged Inferno in under 4 attempts. Until you exceed that, speed is encouraged.
