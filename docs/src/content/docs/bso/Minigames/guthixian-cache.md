title: "Guthixian Cache"
---

A daily divination minigame with the following features:

- **Frequency:** Once per UTC day.
- **Rewards:**
  - Diviners outfit pieces (40% chance of receiving an unowned piece).
  - Each completion will give you a Guthixian cache boost that buffs your next. However, if you have `Cache portent` charges, your boost will instead be converted into an item that can be traded/used.
  - The [Divination master cape](../custom-items/equippables/#master-capes) has a 25% chance to award a second cache boost upon completion.
