### Overview

In this minigame, you play the role of a Boiler and Herbalist. Your job is to heat the water, and infuse it with herbs to give the water special properties.

- You heat the water using ore, logs and coal. You need better ore/logs for higher tiers (e.g. Runite ore for Fiery temperature)
- Herbs are used to make a water mixture (e.g. Vitalizing), you can use whichever you want. Using one that the species' prefers will earn you extra tips.
- You infuse the water with mixtures of herb pairs (e.g. Ranarr and Tarromin), your choice of which to use.
- There are 3 tiers (Warm, Hot, and Fiery), they in increase in difficulty and requirements, but higher tiers give better xp, higher unique chances, and tips.
- You get Herblore and Firemaking experience for your work, as well as occasional tips from the customers.

There are multiple species that are served in this minigame, each with their own preferences.
