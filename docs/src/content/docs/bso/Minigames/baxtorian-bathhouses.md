In this minigame, you play the role of a Boiler and Herbalist. Your job is to heat the water, and infuse it with herbs to give the water special properties.

- You heat the water using ore, logs and coal. You need better ore/logs for higher tiers (e.g. Runite ore for Fiery temperature)
- Herbs are used to make a water mixture (e.g. Vitalizing), you can use whichever you want. Using one that the species' prefers will earn you extra tips.
- You infuse the water with mixtures of herb pairs (e.g. Ranarr and Tarromin), your choice of which to use.
- There are 3 tiers (Warm, Hot, and Fiery), they in increase in difficulty and requirements, but higher tiers give better xp, higher unique chances, and tips.
