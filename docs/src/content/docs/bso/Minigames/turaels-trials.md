Fight waves of superior monsters using one of three combat styles: melee, mage or range.
Start a trip with `[/bsominigames turaels_trials start method:melee]` (or mage/range).
Each wave lasts about 2.9 minutes per kill.

## Requirements

- [[slayer:120]]
- Appropriate gear and supplies for your chosen style

## Costs per trip

- Melee: [[Super combat potion(4)]] and Scythe of Vitur charges
- Mage: [[Magic potion(4)]] plus Chaos, Death and Water runes
- Range: [[Ranging potion(4)]] and Black chinchompas
- All methods: 3 [[Saradomin brew (4)]] and [[Super restore (4)]]
  - Roughly 50 hitpoints of healing is needed per minute
  - Equipping an [[Amulet of blood fury]] extends trip length by 20%

## Experience

Each kill gives 36k Slayer XP and about 89k XP split between your combat stats.
Melee uses Scythe of Vitur charges, mage consumes runes and range expends black chinchompas.

This minigame offers no loot but very fast combat and Slayer experience.
