title: "Ourania Delivery Service (ODS)"
---

The Ourania Delivery Service (ODS) is similar to Gnome Restaurant, but instead of delivering food, you **craft runes** and deliver them to **wizards in need**.

Start a trip: [[/bsominigames ourania_delivery_service start]]

Youâ€™ll receive **Runecraft XP** and **Ourania tokens** based on your performance.

> Requires **Pure essence** to participate.

## Optimal Strategy

Equip **Kuro** and have **Roboflappy** in your bank to receive both pet bonuses.
