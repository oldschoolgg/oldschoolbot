title: "Ourania Delivery Service (ODS)"
---

The ODS is like the Gnome Restaurant, except instead of delivering food, you craft runes and then deliver them to Wizards in need.

It's a pretty simple activity to do, the only requirement is that you have Pure essence to craft the runes with.

You can start a trip using `/bsominigames ourania_delivery_service start`

After finishing deliveries, you'll get Runecraft XP and Ourania tokens. The tokens can be spent on a few rewards. You can buy rewards using tokens with `/bsominigames ourania_delivery_service buy name:[Item name]`.

Because both Kuro and Flappy provide benefits to Ourania Delivery Service, it is optimal to have a Roboflappy in the bank and equip Kuro to get the benefit of both.

## ODS Shop

Through ODS, you get Ourania tokens which scale with your Runecraft level. You can check how many tokens you have with `/bsominigames ourania_delivery_service stats`.

These are the things you can buy with the tokens:

| Item                     | Tokens |
| ------------------------ | ------ |
| Master Runecrafter Hat   | 250    |
| Master Runecrafter Robe  | 350    |
| Master Runecrafter Skirt | 300    |
| Master Runecrafter Boots | 200    |
| Elder Thread             | 500    |
| Elder Talisman           | 350    |
| Magic Crate              | 115    |

- **Master runecrafter hat/robe/skirt/boots:** Gives 10% bonus XP when Runecrafting and must be equipped in skilling or misc.
- **Elder thread:** Can be used to upgrade an Abyssal pouch to make it carry significantly more essence, which hugely increases Runecraft XP/hr. Requires 105 RC to use and a spare abyssal pouch for maximum benefit.
- **Elder talisman:** Allows you to be able to runecraft Elder runes, if it's in your bank. Crafting Elder runes is the best Runecraft XP/hr.
- **Magic Crate**: A mystery box that has a chance to win a Huge Lamp or Magus Scroll
