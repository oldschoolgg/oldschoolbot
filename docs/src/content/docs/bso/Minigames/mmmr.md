6. [[/bso minigames monkey_rumble start]]

- You need an M'speak amulet and a rumble greegree (buy them) to compete. You start with a Beginner rumble greegree, and after doing more games, you unlock higher greegrees.
- Higher greegrees (monkey tiers) increase XP and chances of unique rewards. XP scales based on your monkey tier and strength level.
- You need food for the fights, but in monkey form, you can only eat fruits. All fruits heal equally, except lychee, avocado, and mango, which give a speed boost.
- Each fight is against a random monkey—there are over 20,000 possible monkeys. Rarely, you will fight a special monkey.
- Special monkeys have purple names and unique appearances. They drop the unique rewards.
- You also earn Rumble tokens, which can be spent on rewards or Monkey crates.
- Monkey Rumble has a collection log: [[/cl name\:Mad Marimbo's Monkey Rumble]]
