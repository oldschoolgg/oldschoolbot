title: "Divine Dominion"
---

Divine Dominion favor is managed with:

- `[/bsominigames divine_dominion check]`
- `[/bsominigames divine_dominion sacrifice_god_item item:<item> quantity:<qty>]`

## Mechanics

- Sacrificing a valid god item gives **10 seconds** of favor per item to that item's god.
- Sacrificed items are consumed.
- `check` shows each god as a capped percentage (`max 100%`).

## Rewards and thresholds

- **80% favor**: grants that god's **Warpriest set** (if you don't already have it in CL).
- **100% favor**: for **Zamorak/Guthix/Saradomin only**, grants the god egg (if you don't already have it in CL).
- Sacrificing to Zamorak/Guthix/Saradomin also has a **1/10,000 per item** roll for that god egg.

## Valid gods and item pools

You can only sacrifice items from these god pools:

- Armadyl
- Bandos
- Guthix
- Saradomin
- Zamorak

These pools include the expected pages, blessed d'hide, god armor pieces, weapons, blessings, and related god items from each set.
