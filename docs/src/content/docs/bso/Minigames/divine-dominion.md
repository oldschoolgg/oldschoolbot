title: "Divine Dominion"
---

Gain favour with the five gods by sacrificing their items. Use `[/bsominigames divine_dominion check]` to see your favour and `[/bsominigames divine_dominion sacrifice_god_item item:]` to offer items. You can also gain favour passively while killing monsters â€“ slaying a creature aligned with one god awards favour with the *other* gods.

## Requirements

- No skill requirements but you must own god items to sacrifice.
- Favour increases 10 seconds per item offered.
- Favour from kills is based on the time spent killing.

## Rewards

- 80% favour grants the matching Warpriest armour set if you don't own it.
- 100% favour grants that god's egg pet if not already in your collection log.
- Each sacrificed item also has a 1/10,000 chance to award the pet immediately.

Godly items include armour, pages, weapons and blessings from Armadyl, Bandos, Guthix, Saradomin and Zamorak.
Common examples are god pages, blessed d'hide pieces and godswords. Sacrificed items are consumed.
