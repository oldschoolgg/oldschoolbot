### [[gc]]

- A new crate, the **Sinister crate (s7)** has been added! It drops **12** unique items, 1 of which is a mega-rare. You can get the crates passively from doing any trip, or buying them on the G.E. You can buy keys for 20m GP to open them. The previous crate is now discontinued.

> ðŸŽƒ **Halloween Side-Event**
>
> Cyr has coded an event for halloween! Note that this is not the main halloween event, which is coming.
>
> To start, any trip, regardless of duration, has a 1/3 chance to trigger the event. Once you get the event start messeage (Pumpkinhead chatbox), you are given a Spookling token.
>
> When completing trips, for every minute, there is a 1 in 12 chance to get a 'trick or treat' point. If you get at least one point, there is a 55% chance of getting a trick, otherwise it's a 'treat.' Trick vs treat doesn't affect pet chance, but only treats can also give you Halloween candy. Themed > messsages differ between tricks and treats, and there are a few different messages for being lucky enough to get the pet also.
>
> Pet drop rate is 1 per 80 trick or treat points (~20 hours) Each pet on CL makes the next one 5x rarer. You also get 1 Spookling token for each trick or treat point. (1 in 12 per minute, or ~5 per hour on average).
>
> You can "cash in" the Spookling tokens by going to /k Pumpkinhead to claim his head, in the form of a Miniature pumpkin head. The cost is 100 Spookling tokens, with a max of 3 heads purchasable. ~25 > hours per head

- Ironmen can now donate item contracts
- Fix box spawn replies

# 2/10/2024

We now have a new wiki at https://wiki.oldschool.gg/, and the BSO Wiki is now combined together with the OSB wiki. Many pages are out of date, I'm trying to update pages when I have time. Currently, the only way to contribute to the new wiki is by editing files in [this folder on github](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/tree/master/docs/src/content/docs).

### [[nwjgit]]

- PMBs now automatically have new pets added
- Allow multiple colosseum attempts per trip
- Add boosts for BSO items to colosseum
- Fixed requirements for Music cape(t)
- Make spooky graceful dc and remove it from the graceful cl
- Remove [[Partyhat set]] & [[Partyhat & specs]] from the creatables CL to the christmas cracker CL
- Updated muspah gear for bso, adding a boost for void staff, hellfire bow, gorajan, etc.
- Fixed the [[Tidal collector (i)]], which now requires 5x Blessed dizana's quiver to create.
