_Generally, only changes which are specific to only BSO (and not OSB) are written here_

## 2/10/2024 [[3e17ea5eb2147dfdd7e874482313305407c53e22]]

We now have a new wiki at https://wiki.oldschool.gg/, and the BSO Wiki is now combined together with the OSB wiki. Many pages are out of date, I'm trying to update pages when I have time. Currently, the only way to contribute to the new wiki is by editing files in [this folder on github](https://github.com/oldschoolgg/oldschoolbot/tree/master/docs/src/content/docs).

### [[nwjgit]]

- PMBs now automatically have new pets added
- Allow multiple colosseum attempts per trip
- Add boosts for BSO items to colosseum
- Fixed requirements for Music cape(t)
- Make spooky graceful dc and remove it from the graceful cl
- Remove [[Partyhat set]] & [[Partyhat & specs]] from the creatables CL to the christmas cracker CL
- Updated muspah gear for bso, adding a boost for void staff, hellfire bow, gorajan, etc.
- Fixed the [[Tidal collector (i)]], which now requires 5x Blessed dizana's quiver to create.
