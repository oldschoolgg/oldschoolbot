On top of the regular implings you can get, there are 4 more you can get in BSO:

**Infernal impling:** (requires 94 hunter) Drops TzHaar-related items, 1 in 1 million chance of Uncut onyx

**Chimpling:** (requires 95 hunter and a magic banana) It can drop seeds, TMB's, GMC's, and the very rare monkey egg.\
A single magic banana is consumed per catch and can be obtained by casting the `/activities enchant name:Banana spell`. This requires a regular banana (which can be farmed or created by casting bones to bananas) and a special enchant banana spell scroll which can be obtained from the [Monkey Rumble minigame](/minigames/mad-marimbos-monkey-rumble).

| Item                      | Rate   |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| Gorilla Rumble greegree   | 1/300  |
| Monkey egg                | 1/7000 |
| Monkey Dye                | 1/3000 |
| Banana Enchantment Scroll | 1/100  |

**Eternal impling:** (requires 99 hunter) Drops magic-related items (staves, runes, orbs) and grandmaster clues. 1 in 1 million chance of Eternal crystal. Eternal implings use magic to make themselves invisible to hide, thus you can only catch them if you have a Vasa cloak in your bank or equipped.

**Mystery impling:** (requires 105 hunter) Drops a tradeable/untradeable/pet/equippable mystery box, can drop a grandmaster clue and has a 1 in 1 million chance of dropping another mystery impling jar.

You can view the collection log for implings with `/cl name:Implings`.
