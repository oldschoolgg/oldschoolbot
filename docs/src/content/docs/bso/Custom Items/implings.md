On top of the regular implings you can get, there are 5 more you can get in BSO:

**Infernal impling** (requires [[hunter:94]]): Drops TzHaar-related items, 1 in 1 million chance of Uncut onyx.

**Shrimpling** (requires [[hunter:97]] and found only at underwater locations): Always drops raw food with a chance at [[Clue scroll (grandmaster)]] and a 1/100 chance for an [[Elder scroll piece]].

**Chimpling** (requires [[hunter:95]] and a magic banana): Can drop seeds, TMBs, GMCs, and the very rare monkey egg. Also has a 1/100 chance for an [[Elder scroll piece]].
A single magic banana is consumed per catch and can be obtained by casting [[/activities enchant name\:Banana spell]]. This requires a regular banana (which can be farmed or created by casting bones to bananas) and a special Enchant Banana Spell Scroll, which can be obtained from the [[Marimbo's Monkey Rumble]].

| Item                      | Rate   |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| Gorilla Rumble greegree   | 1/300  |
| Monkey egg                | 1/7000 |
| Monkey Dye                | 1/3000 |
| Banana Enchantment Scroll | 1/100  |

**Eternal impling** (requires [[hunter:99]]): Drops magic-related items (staves, runes, orbs) and Grandmaster clues. Has a 1/100 chance for an [[Elder scroll piece]] and a 1 in 1 million chance of an Eternal crystal. Eternal implings use magic to make themselves invisible to hide, thus you can only catch them if you have a Vasa cloak in your bank or equipped.

**Mystery impling** (requires [[hunter:105]]): Drops a tradeable/untradeable/pet/equippable mystery box, can drop a Grandmaster clue, and has a 1/100 chance for an [[Elder scroll piece]]. It also has a 1 in 1 million chance of dropping another mystery impling jar.
