### Master Capes

Master capes are skillcapes that can be purchased upon getting 500M XP in the respective skill. The command to purchase a master cape is `/buy name:[Skill name] master cape`. Each cape costs 1b gp to purchase and is untradeable. Master capes provide an 8% XP boost if training the corresponding skill, or 3% when training any other skill. This perk is global, and the master cape can be equipped in any gear tab to receive the XP boost. Master capes also have the same stats as an Abyssal Cape without the food reduction perk.

Additionally, master capes have a perk that is related to the skill that they correspond to. Skills with missing perks are yet to be added.
